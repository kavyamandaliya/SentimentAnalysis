Sorry, my arms are killing me from M.E.   If you are watching the content creators on YouTube who Yang and Zach recognise and drop by to chat with after town halls, you’ll know yang and Zach have said that the Iowa ads are working, with big smiles on their faces.   

The path for victory for Yang is shocking the world with delegates from IA, NH and NV.   SC has a history of not polling for who they really want, then voting for who they really want when that person gets delegates from the first 3 states.   That phenomenon then drives a domino effect through the rest of the primaries, as the media goes into a feeding frenzy over the delegate results in the 4 first states, and any unexpected results.   

This is what you have to work with.
So for the last month I've been tasked with looking into this and coming up with a solution for our medium sized business. 

In case you're unaware, here's the gist of why this is a thing now:

https://mashable.com/article/supreme-court-reject-dominos-inaccessible-website/

I'd appreciate any anecdotes from a sysadmin point of view, best practices, applications etc.
There's no way the entire HKPF filled with individuals agree on the level of force used against the protestors and public. I understand the fear of going against your colleagues but if a foreign entity can offer asylum to a whistleblower then the dominos can begin to fall in the right direction. 

From what I have read, the best candidate would be Germany? 

Thoughts? I figure this would be an interesting notion to discuss.





So I've seen posts kind of skirting around this topic before/wanting to somehow revolt and hold schools more accountable (lol) but I'm more curious on the reasoning behind the ambiguity of knowing where applications are in the process? I understand that it's very dynamic in terms of ordering applications according to the school's internal decisions, conducting interviews and factoring in how the cycle is looking in terms of filling seats, but why can't there just be the most basic of communication along the way? I know some schools have this to a degree so what prevents the others? Its a busy and stressful time for admission offices but were also paying a decent fee &amp; waiting several months in darkness. Hopefully this doesn't come off as too bitter and more so just looking for perspective

Tl;dr I want a dominos pizza tracker for our applications, gimme it
Hello I was watching the latest Rationality Rules video and I commented that watching and reading people like william lane craig, NT Wright, and Justin Brierley's show Unbelievable has helped in my deconversion from christianity and theism in general.  I was approached with  this comment.  I think it is of high quality and deserves a response but everytime I try to write it out it comes out as rambling.  Could anyone here make a succinct response to these criticisms?

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfAWALcKf2w&amp;lc=UgyGhGDsChMu-Ev3llV4AaABAg.90gLNkNphMA916Hz9nSAHA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfAWALcKf2w&amp;lc=UgyGhGDsChMu-Ev3llV4AaABAg.90gLNkNphMA916Hz9nSAHA)

&amp;#x200B;

*Let me first address one critical point: “I was an active Christian for 25 years. It's the pursuit of truth and honesty that has brought me to the point of de converting.” – Pursuit of truth and honesty. Hmm. So, you believe the ff.:*

*1. that “truth and honesty” are genuine and truly of great value,*

*2. and that they can be discovered, and that we do have the capacity to discover them,*

*3. and that intuitively, we do have a sense of responsibility, even a moral responsibility, to live in pursuit of truth and honesty,*

*4. and that these “brought” you “to the point of de converting”, and thus you also believe in the real possibility of authentic change—a metanoia—a radical change of mind, perspective, thoughts, feelings, life—because of the pursuit of “truth and honesty”.*

*Correct?*

*Question: Can you give me a compelling and logically coherent explanation and justification WHY #1,2,3,4 above are all true? Wait, since you seem to embrace the atheism of Rat Rules and the new atheism, can you give me EMPIRICAL proof for all of the above?*

*#1-4 above lead me to assume that you also believe in,*

*5. the genuine realities of consciousness, mind, and reason and that these are not merely epiphenomenon of that gray matter inside our skulls. That the operations of mind and reason are not simply brainfarts.*

*If so, what best explains such phenomena?*

*Let’s remember the fact that full-on atheistic naturalism can’t escape reductive materialism that in turn can’t escape an ultimate nihilism (more logically consistent atheists e.g., Sartre, Camus, Nietzsche, Russel openly admit that fact), with the inevitable implication of physical determinism \[admitted by Stephen here\] that explains (rather, EXPLAINS AWAY to better put it) consciousness, mind, reason, and free will as:*

&amp;#x200B;

*1) illusions (the ‘it’s all an illusion’ crowd), just activities of this gray matter (just tricks conjured up by nonrational or even irrational neurons firing and synapses snapping),*

*2) epiphenomena or brainfarts of that same soft and spongy grey thingy, absolutely without causal powers, i.e., they don’t cause us to make genuine choices and decisions based on reasoned contemplation of thoughts and ideas, following principles of logic and inference, and that our thinking that we actually think, reason, choose, decide via a genuine will based on the rules of logic and inference weighing concepts, ideas, observations is again one big illusion, a mere joke played on us by atoms and molecules acting up (like shaking a soda bottle).*

*3) that we’re really just nature’s (brute, nonrational, irrational nature) puppets, and that we’re “free” so long as we “love our strings” as Sam Harris put it; that it’s really nature’s brute (irrational) forces that pull all the strings from the Big Bang right up to my actions of typing right now (and you reading what I type)—all just dominos falling, avalanche crashing, landslide tumbling down—no free will, no genuine reason operating, no authentic mind wrestling with, and weighing thoughts, concepts, ideas using abstract rules of logic and inference; just electro-chemical activities with no remainder, nothing outside the clockwork, all but interlocked mechanisms conjuring illusions of free will.*

&amp;#x200B;

*So, which to you is a more existentially and intellectually compelling, coherent, satisfying, and even intuitively correct explanation—is it #5 or 1), 2), 3)?  If #5, what best explains that—a theistic worldview or an atheistic-naturalistic-physicalist worldview?  If 1), 2), 3) then are you really a ‘you’ after all (or merely a series of brain states)? Are you really thinking? Are you really capable of #1,2,3,4?*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  Thank you people of this community.  These responses were exactly what I was hoping for. I feel fairly confident that how I have come to my decision to anti-theism has been fairly thorough, however I find it difficult to explain this worldview against theists.  I love communities like these, videos by Rationality Rules, Cosmic Skeptic and the Counter Apologetics podcast but I feel like jordan Peterson just saying that I can't explain it well enough so go listen to these videos.  I felt like this person was a bad actor and very smug but I was concerned that there was something I was missing but it turns out that he was arguing in bad faith.        Thanks again, you guys are great
It works like this: The CIA causes some sort of conflict to occur at the country of interest usually by some false flag scenario which causes the domino effect of people fleeing their country to the United States where they can escape the problem the US intentionally created in the first place. Makes you wonder if the US as a front makes it out to be a problem so the masses would argue the situation to divide and conquer and create opposing groups and also makes you wonder if they intentionally know what there doing and want to disrupt the job industry by letting them take all the jobs. To me this whole conspiracy makes sense on many levels and illegal immigration does a lot to further USA’s agendas. The US population can also be artificially inflated this way without people needing to breed new offspring.

Sorry for keeping you guys waiting. IRL hit me hard and I've been busy with work. But I was able to crank out the final installment.

# CAST:

Really the only new person in this installment is Halloween. A young girl with a jealous streak. If you've gotten this far and don't know everyone by now, just check the previous posts for the cast list.

## First.

I would like to kick this last part off with a reminder.

This was never written with the intent to “expose” people. It wasn’t meant to humiliate them. It wasn’t meant to “warn” people about them.

Were we frustrated by the actions of these individuals? Yes. But we do not hate them. Hell, I was just having a casual chat with Starfy just the other day. She’s a good kid, she means well. But she’s still a *kid* and kids will do stupid things.

All we wanted was to play a game, but then things got… Stupid. Stupid and frustrating.

If there is one thing that readers should take away from this story is that this server as a whole was a prime example of miscommunication, creative differences clashing, overly emotional petty drama, and as a whole, this entire situation was completely unnecessary. If you find yourself in an RP server, make sure you communicate with your fellow players. Also, know that mental illness isn’t an excuse for doing shitty things. 

Also, know that I *do* have screenshots, but I don't know if I'll be dropping them or not. If I do, I'll be editing out usernames and profile pics for the privacy of everyone. If I do end up dropping them I might include them in either an edit or in the comments. But overall, I don't think they're all that important if only to give you guys a better sense of how these people actually spoke/behaved.

Now on with the story.

# THE MAY 11TH DISASTER

Okay, I’ll admit I’m overexaggerating a bit BUT May 11th *was* a fucking trainwreck to watch.

Basically this event is a domino effect of depression and mental illness. People going “it’s all my fault”, “no it’s all MY fault and I hate myself”, “no *I’m* the worst person”. And all-around a mess of crying because of an argument characters were having in the RP.

It all started with Paul, of course, because by this point The Trio had officially started targeting Paul and his characters. Whether this was intentional or not, I’m not sure. But they wouldn’t stop talking about him or his characters. They always had some hateful comments aimed at his character. No matter how hard Paul tried, he felt like nothing he did was good enough, because those three would immediately undermine his posts. It really hit his self-esteem and made him lose confidence in playing.

Meanwhile Ms. Roboto was feeling a little bit extra grumpy because we had recently nerfed her character. The Mods had to step in because she was utilizing exploits in the rules system with weird bullshit science to explain why suddenly her character had the ability to make anything she wanted at any point in time (this includes weapons and armor). She also had planted cameras all over the place, even inside character rooms. Spying on literally everything and everyone and inserting herself into certain situations that people didn’t really want her apart of. We had gotten some complaints about her being too OP and that she was abusing loopholes in the system. She was actually on her way to making weapons that would have been Super Broken, and the way she was using the cameras had us concerned. So we decided to nerf her. Ms. Roboto was notified by Slorp of the issue. Sparkle Bean went through with the nerfing via PM and the Secret Boy account. Once Ms. Roboto found out that Sparkle Bean was the one who had carried out the Nerf (I.e. breaking the cameras ominously to build up tension) she got kind of salty. Now leading both her and Bird to make jabs towards Sparkle Bean's events/characters/anything she was involved in.

Anyway, back to May 11th.

It was your average night. Nothing much to talk about. Paul was just doing his thing, playing his asshole character who wasn’t doing much of anything. I can’t remember what was the straw that broke the camel’s back in the chat. I believe what happened was:

Someone’s Character accusing Paul’s character (Shade) of never changing. Ms. Roboto and Shifter agreeing. A few characters defending Shade saying he HAS changed and developed, but he’s just an asshole in general. I believe at one point Shifter’s character jumped into the fray and was slightly criticized by a couple of characters for being kind of “Not very helpful” and Shifter getting upset and feeling attacked and like her character had changed for the better (even though “better” meant being extremely submissive and way too eager to please). Ms. Roboto also was fiercely defending Shifter. Bird was nowhere to be seen after a certain point but they were beginning to throw a fit in the OOC chat. This fictional argument apparently had Real World meaning to these three because they all got extremely defensive and acting as if everyone around them were bullying them. Even though the worst we did was critique (not in a mean way), give some advice, and just be like “eh i’m personally not a fan of this character but ok”.

It actually wasn’t even that *bad* of an argument. It came off more as a minor disagreement than anything, but then things got blown up out of proportion.

The argument escalated and I stepped in trying to see if I could calm everything down. I was able to emotionally distance myself from everything and try to do some damage control. But most of what I was doing was behind the scenes in the private voice call I was in with the other Revolutionaries.

Shifter decided that the only way to stop all the fighting (it really wasn’t *that* much fighting looking back, and it wasn’t even that *bad*) was to remove her God character. Just get rid of him. This was her third character, mind you. However, I could see that this was a spur of the moment decision that was bound to cause regret so I said I’d give her 24 hours to seriously think about it. If she changed her mind, she could DM me.

The conversation in that channel died down and the drama shifted to one of the vent chats. #another-vent-if-needed. It honestly SHOULDNT have been needed, but this was a server full of emotional teens so leave it to hormonal children and the emotionally sensitive to fill up *three channels* worth of drama.

This part is… A little hard to summarize. A lot of it was trying to console feelings. The Trio being upset still, beating themselves up due to their respective mental illnesses blowing things out of proportion. Others were trying to help them, but not much headway was made, I feel. Mental illness is a bitch, but it also doesn’t instantly excuse someone’s actions. I felt bad for the trio’s issues, but they *were* all adults bullying a child and thinking IC feelings = OOC feelings. So it’s a complex situation. I don’t hate them for what they did, but their bad habits and tendencies to invent problems made me realize that I’m not equipped to help these people. I’m not a psychologist. Nobody in that server was, and because of that we didn’t know how to properly deal with these problems. We were as nice as we could be, we tried to give them solutions to maybe reduce stress, but everything was turned down with excuses. In the end, we’re not mental health professionals. We can’t help these people, and because of their untreated mental issues, they were actively hurting others and themselves. The whole situation was messy but luckily nobody was physically hurt. Which was one of my biggest concerns. I don’t know if any of them were prone to self-harm, but I really didn’t want to take any chances, hence why I was helping some of the members of the Revolution when they were talking to the Trio. I didn’t directly speak to them because my status as “head mod” tended to scare the shit out of people. All of us were in a voice call and whenever someone was having a hard time phrasing things, I would toss in my own suggestions. Basically tossing out scripts that sometimes one of the others would take from. Not often, mind you, but occasionally. Mainly, I was an observer and a listening ear for those who were becoming uncomfortable by the whole situation.

The main issue was, the three of them were all having simultaneous mental breakdowns. They had jumped into a voice call, where Bird proceeded to cry, Shifter I think also cried. There was a lot of venting and self loathing, beating themselves up over this game. Complaining and sometimes trying to justify their shitty behavior, trying to blame it on everybody else but themselves. Threats to leave the server, general self-pitying. That kinda stuff. They apparently thought Paul was 20, which was why they were getting so hard on him and his characters, and why they thought it was ok. Paul was 15 at the time of these events. A child. The stress they put him through made him have a few private breakdowns himself and possibly almost made him quit RPing altogether.

But what came from this night? Not much, really.

The trio took a bit of a break, I think the only one who really stayed active was Ms. Roboto. Bird went on a long hiatus and Shifter DMed me within the 24 hour period telling me she wanted to keep her character. So despite the crying and dramatic statements of leaving, nothing super bad really came from it. However, they didn’t feel the need to pick on Paul anymore, which is really all we wanted.

But at least there were apologies from Shifter and Bird to Paul about them ruining the game for him. Ms. Roboto would apologize constantly, even when it wasn’t needed or being thought about. However, Bird grew pretty distant from everyone and was still OOC hateful of characters. Shifter and Ms. Roboto continued to have weird RPs with concerning subtext, however it was more isolated and people were now avoiding being in the same room as those two characters. So it looked like they all threw a fit over nothing. While we were annoyed we didn’t make a big stink about it because it was time to end the Mansion’s Story once and for all.

# THE END OF THE MANSION

After a few weeks of planning, the final week of the main storyline was announced. It was time for all-out War.

Events each and every day. Characters fighting for their lives for seven days against intimidating enemies from the abyss. This final week was our love letter, our wish for what could have been, and my goodbye to the server.

Willowmen stalked the halls and attacked characters on sight. Hoards of mites would occasionally run through the hallways, completely swamping them like a deadly living mass. Anyone unfortunate enough to get caught in the stampede had to get lucky or else they’d take heavy damage or outright die. It was intense, thrilling, and widely loved by the players. We had some amazing highlights Save for a few who weren’t into the whole “action-adventure” stuff and wanted to focus on slice-of-life.

Speaking of, here’s an entertaining little side story: Let me tell you about a player named Halloween who was also in the server. She, like Shifter, went through quite a few character changes and had a few bad habits of her own, but really didn’t do anything that warranted much besides the occasional reminder of rules.

Halloween’s first character wasn’t really well received by a few people. The character would turn around, do shitty things like torture Furby’s character, and then both player and character would be surprised when other characters didn’t want to be around them. The characterization was all over the place. It was like they wanted a “bad guy” or at least somewhat morally ambiguous character without having to face the consequence of the other characters not liking them. The minute the character was criticized for anything wrong they did, Halloween both IC and OOC would burst into tears and basically go “but, i’m baby.” Halloween’s character is also the one that started a trend of character’s committing suicide to get attention and which eventually led to a whole “No Pointless Suicide” rule to be implemented.

Halloween also really wanted to be a mod. Which only would have made the mod situation worse. She routinely got jealous of any new mods added to the roster and would go into other servers and talk about it as if it were a horrible place that kept overlooking her. Even Starfy and Pasta agreed that Halloween would not have made a good mod. So that bullet was dodged.

She was one of the kinds of people who loved “slice-of-life”, not that there’s anything wrong with small casual moments between characters. However, Halloween was not a big fan of the War of Darkness. So what does she do? She grabs her anxious friend Conductor, they go into one of their character rooms, and then they proceed to RP the entirety of Bendy and the Ink Machine only with Halloween as the main character. It was totally unrelated and it was so active that it was practically spamming everyone’s notifications to the point most people muted them.

Since none of the other mods were going to do it, I stepped in with a super nice and polite message basically like: “I’m sorry but I don’t see how what’s been going on in here relates to the themes/purpose of this server. I’m not against people doing their own thing, but this isn’t a Bendy and the Ink Machine server. I know we have various references to various properties across media, but the point is for this server to be a place for original content. You guys aren’t in trouble, but I’d appreciate it if you could continue this RP in your DMs, please. If you’d like any help coming up with ideas for the current content/events going on feel free to ask and I’ll help!”

Or… something like that. I can’t get the exact wording because that channel has since been deleted. What I do know is that neither one of the two of them responded and instead just fucking vanished. Poof. Gone. That one message from me, lightly scolding and offering alternatives was enough to spook both children out of the server. Halloween was still present in some other mutual servers but never said a word. Probably due to embarrassment. Conductor was never to be seen again, which was a pity because she had a good character. She was just way too afraid to interact with anyone, waiting for the interaction and excitement to come to *her* instead of sticking her neck out to find it.

It just goes to show that the War of Darkness wasn’t for everybody. And that’s ok. We weren’t forcing people to stay or forcing them to leave. This is how we wanted to end things, a big climactic battle between the Mansion and the Residents. And oh how climactic it was.

My servant character was freed in an amazing boss battle that me and those who participated adored, ending in a touching scene as she was welcomed back to the group by friends. (We made a few people cry with how touching the whole thing was). Some characters got to show off their skills and abilities. Puppet Master and Imito’s story was brought to a tear-jerking end as they died in the crumbling caverns in one another’s arms. Two friends born into service of a God they no longer cared for by the end of their respective arcs. (Bird, of course, felt the need to comment “I feel nothing. I hated them.” While everyone else was complimenting Hattie and Sparkle Bean for their writing.) And of course, there was the big climactic battle against the Dark God himself. It was our biggest event ever, a pain to DM, but it was worth it for our big final boss battle.

The final blow was struck. The Dark God fell apart. And for the first time in the RP: the sun rose. The floodgates were open, the character restrictions were lifted allowing people to bring in as many characters as they wanted, along with a new Open Exploration feature that allowed characters to explore the worlds of others. Some characters said their goodbyes. I too said my goodbye, Servant walking into the light of the new morning sun and vanishing. And when she vanished I simply said "Thanks for Playing" in the announcements and left the server. It was a good night, and afterward, everyone was feeling optimistic about a new beginning. My sudden departure was shocking to most, but it wasn’t goodbye forever. We still had a few mutual servers up but nothing RP related.

I was done with the Mansion though. And with my story wrapped up, I felt like all the pressure was lifted. For the next couple of weeks, things seemed OK in the mansion. No big drama. Nothing. People were RPing peacefully, but with no direction, my initial prediction for the mansion started to come true. It started to die very quickly. Maybe it was just burnout. Maybe it was a lack of direction. Whatever the case, the server has long gone quiet.

The Mansion’s 1 year anniversary has recently passed and it is a graveyard. A silent server with only occasional comments and memes being sent. No more RPs. Everyone has gone into their own little servers to keeping RPing.

Starfy, Pasta, and a few others are running their own private server where they can have as much slice of life and weird game-breaking portal shenanigans as they want. 

Bird seems to be doing better mentally and isn’t nearly as stressed as they originally were. 

Ms. Roboto seems to be doing well too, but she still seems to be kinda oblivious to limits. 

As for Shifter, nobody is really sure how she’s doing. She’s dropped out of all servers. Nobody has heard from her since the Mansion ended. I hope wherever she is, she is doing well, and if not: I hope things get better. 

Savvy had a hard time talking to others for a while after the events of the mansion. But she’s recently been RPing in other servers and has since been improving and getting out of the rut she had been stuck in. 

As for Hattie, Sparkle Bean, Paul, Furby, me, and the rest of the Revolution? Well, we’ve moved on to our own endeavors. We still RP with one another and have game nights. We’re doing well, having fun, and doing our own drama-free thing.

# CLOSING THOUGHTS

Again, as stated at the beginning of this installment, this 4-part series wasn’t made to call out the individuals talked about. Rather, it was my way of trying to chronicle the dumb shit that happened. It was dumb and ridiculous. People lashing out from stress. Children not knowing any better. The overall atmosphere of the mansion was toxic. Sometimes I blame myself for that. I was considered the head Mod after all. I think I somehow contributed to the toxic mindsets that brewed. Now, I’m too afraid to take any kind of server leadership role. I’m just… Not active enough and I’m way too easily distracted. I bounce from interest to interest, leaving projects unfinished until I feel motivated enough to come back to them at a much later date. So, no more modding for me. At least not for a while.

But despite this, at least we were able to end things before they escalated further. Imagine the kind of hell the server would be if it survived to see it’s first anniversary? I don’t even want to imagine it.

Take from this story what you will. But at least now we all can just let it go and look back at everything and laugh at the ridiculousness of everything. And now you guys can laugh along with us too.

But yeah, communicate with your RP partners. Don’t be a spotlight hog. Don’t pick on someone just because you don’t like their character. And just use some common sense. Thanks for sticking with me for this whole saga. I hope you at least found it a little bit entertaining.
So with Senna and her Story being released Riot basically confirmed that the Ruined King is still out there and searching Tombs for "something". 

Since I have a lot of time to think while being at work i thought of how to implement him as a playable Champion. Feedback is well apreciated. I will be refeering to the ruined king as TRK for now on, since i dont have a name in mind yet.

ABILITIES:

&amp;#x200B;

Passive: Host of the Black Mist

TRK has a aura of black mist surrounding him. Enemies / Large and small Monsters / enemy minions dying in that aura come back as small mist wraiths (simillar to yorick's ghouls) with a small aura of mist around them aswell. Enemy Champions that are caught to long in the mist (like 3-4 secs) become cursed now being hosts of the mist themselfes.

After like 5-10 seconds the "curse" goes away but refreshes as they stand in the aura of TRK or the wraiths / other hosts. The small wraiths run at enemy champs doing little to no damage but are also able to curse them. Upon spawning their HP starts decreasing (the lengh of their lifespan is determined by the lvl of TRK).

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Grasp of the Mist

TRK sends out a Claw of Mist that upon hitting an enemy champ curses them and slows them. If the skillshot hits a mist wraith or their aura the lengh of the skillshot refreshes (kinda like Zoes E with walls does). Upon hitting an already cursed champion they get rooted istead of slowed.

&amp;#x200B;

W: Kings Unholy Tribute / Mists Tribute / Command the Mist

TRK gains movement speed and increases his passive aura a bit. The mist now dammages enemies for X amount of dammage. Cursed Targets in range of the passive aura get their life drained instead healing TRK for X amount.  


&amp;#x200B;

E: Mantle of Mist / Mistcloud 

TRK mantles himself in a cloud of black mist now being able to traverse a wall / terrain for 2-4 seconds. TRK is stil able to cast spells while going through walls but gets shown (kinda like kayns E, exept for the heal)

&amp;#x200B;

R: Ruination

TRK casts out a powerful spell (like an AOE Explosion) dealing dammage to the enemies around him. Cursed enemies aswell as mist wraiths in the radius of the explosion start exploding aswell creating a domino effect. after the spell his passive is disabled for like 5 secs as he just used a giant aoe attack.

&amp;#x200B;

side notes: he would be a mage, since he is able to cast spells n stuff, duh. Also upont casting the ruination for the first time he lost his sword witch is now bork lol.   


  
STORY / CHARACTER CONCEPT 

&amp;#x200B;

The Ruined King gone mad by the loss of his Queen now wanders the lands searching for her soul or smth like that. His personality is basically split between the mad king who lost his wife and tries to resurrect her ever since and a second personality witch is aware of the ruination and the dammage he caused now wishing only to end his life to be with his Queen. 

That means after every ult u cast you get either personality 1 or 2 going from insane to depressed. As an example he would adress kalista as a traitor for not wanting to help her queen but as soon as he is in personality 2 (where he knows what happended because of him he would apologise or promise to end all of their suffering etc. Same with heca and other shadow isles champs.

For the looks: id imagine him looking like a depressed version of the ghost king od the Lord of the Rings, lol. 

I think the split personality also would explain the mist mooving around since he is either trying to still find his queen or to find a artifact or magic source strong enough to end him and the mist itself.

&amp;#x200B;

GAMEPLAY:

Now for the Gameplay i imagined as the player or the hosts for that matter that you really feel the despair you cause. Witch means bushes and turrets rot / fall apart / crumble a bit as you walk by, You can hear lost souls begging for their end or to be alive again. Theese visuals would be only for the player playing TRK or the one being cursed so noone can track em down liek it happended with swain on release.

When TRK ults there is screaming from himself begging for forgivness or from going mad as all the souls around him join in to the chorus of the dead. In general its very important to me that you feel what he feels or atleast for a bit ; despair.

With Riot trying new ways to make the player feel scared (fiddle rework) and other stuff i think it would be really great to see a new champ that just causes despair wherever he goes. (And if he meets amumu even TRK feels pity for him lol)

&amp;#x200B;

SKINS

The skins are free for the champ, there are so many cool concepts:

Elderwood Sage (little groots running at enemies n stuff)

Mecha (An AI that builds robots with the passive n stuff)

Infernal Lord (Shits on Fire YO)

&amp;#x200B;

Thats it for now. I really apreciate some feedback and if you guys like it i am sure i can think of some more champs. I really hope someone from Riot sees this or i get to inspire some folks for other ideas surrounding the concept of TRK being a champ.

PS: If against all odds this ends up happening (witch is kinda not really possible but a man can hope) i wish for a 0.001% of a mist wraith spawning with a top hat running in the opposite direction like i with my silver dreams do. Thats more like my personal make a wish since the only cancer i have is inflicted by soloq and still growing day after day for like 5 years now.

have a good one.  
 

Sir Special / Raybob Johnson

what do you know i have a split personality aswell ;)

To say that I've gone through hell during the last 14 months is a gross understatement. The highlights: loss and grief, substance abuse, addiction, psychological and physical abuse, lost my job, tried to end my life. 2 months ago I started a weightlifting routine and it's helping me **so much** after only 2 months, I really wanted to share it here in case there are others who are considering something similar and could use a bit of a push. Even if you've never thought of weight training, if you're curious do give it a try! [Here's a progress pic of the last 2 months](https://imgur.com/a/bqlc6SB); it doesn't look like much, but a lot of the progress is happening inside :)

Symptoms are very much still there, exercise doesn't help with them; I track them daily and haven't spotted any important changes. I definitely don't see that "exercise and diet and you'll get better" effect. For example, I can still go to the gym, feel amazing, come back and have a meltdown leading to suicidal ideation. Twice I've gone into crisis while at the gym. But it has helped enormously to improve my lifestyle and feel a bit better about myself; I feel stronger not only physically, but mentally. It also takes a good chunk of the day, so they don't feel so endlessly long (a big problem for me at the moment). The most valuable thing in my opinion has been the "domino effect" exercising brings, as it filters through other areas of my life. Some examples:

* Because I'm working quite hard in the gym, the motivation to not take substances and overeat in the evenings is way, way bigger/stronger. As a result I've stopped drinking and smoking almost altogether.
* Because I'm commuting to and from the gym I'm spending more time outside, walking, catching up with emails, reading, being around people. These activities sometimes help me to get me out of my head for a bit.
* Because I need something to do while I'm in between sets, I've restarted listening to music and fallen in love with it all over again (I have a background in music and can't overemphasise how important this has been for me).
* Because I'm keeping track of my weight I can get a very clear sense of progression through simple numbers. Even in my lower days, I've at least got that.

I've even been able to come off antidepressants for the first time in 2 years. I'm still taking other meds but I had been feeling that SSRIs were no longer effective (which they weren't, can confirm after 2 months off) and made no sense to continue. I wanted to stop taking them but was too scared of the withdrawal and now thanks to weigh training (and the associated improvements it's helping me achieve) I've felt mentally stronger and have had the appropriate lifestyle to push through withdrawal. I didn't turn to substance abuse because I've been feeling more disciplined and able to resist unhealthy cravings.

I'd be more than happy to recommend resources and share tips; I've also gotten really into nutrition so I can share a bit more about that too. Whatever helps.

This is my experience and it may not work exactly the same for others, but I often wish there was more about recovery among all the venting stories in Reddit (which are also important!). For once I feel like I have a small something to share with others. The road I have ahead is full of challenges and difficult, scary times; having started weight training is really helping me as I continue to take it one day at a time.

Thanks for listening!


Or is it too different.  They seem somewhat similar and KD is a family favorite.

I’ve got an online code for a free medium 2-topping pizza from Domino’s. If you’d like it, put “pizza” somewhere in your comment and one person will be randomly selected. Thanks (: 

Note: code isn’t valid *until* 11/18 and has to be redeemed online for delivery.

 It's another year and my third post of Infrastructure you can add to your Demon the Descent game. Comments and criticism are appreciated. Hopefully this will inspire some people with their God-Machine storylines.

The theme I was going for this round was r/nosleep and CreepyPasta stories. Though I've added a few that don't fall into that category.  Please let me know what you think.

Previous rounds of Infrastructure:

* [Round 1](https://amp.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/6zh7pl/dtd_14_examples_of_infrastructure_all_categories/) \- 14 Infrastructures.
* [Round 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/8pq4ku/dtd_17_examples_of_infrastructure/)\- 17 Infrastructures.

# Concealment Infrastructure:

\&gt;Means to hide an operation from outsiders. Some Concealment Infrastructures are mundane, like a fake restaurant to keep mortals from exploring the basement; others are supernatural, which likely explains why so few beings have a clue of the existence of the Machine.

## Static Channel

The dead channel full of static. Those who watch it begin seeing strange things. Some say monsters live inside the static.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

The static channel is used concealing video messages, angels, and cryptids. It is a bolthole type pocket dimension to keep things hidden. This dimension can take whatever form the God-machine and his servants want. Including television programs acted by simulacrum.

\*Security:\*

The channel is usually tied to only one TV, but sometimes two or more TVs can access the same static channel. Once inside the static channel the only way out is for the TV to still be on. Turning it off or switching channels will break the link. The connection can be reestablished if the TV is turned back on and sent to the same channel.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When tuned in the TV will give off Aether as white light..

\*Linchpin:\*

Smashing the TV’s screen will destroy the static channel. Once all TV’s connected to the channel are destroyed the static channel and everything inside it will be destroyed.

## Doorway to Hell

Over the world there have been reports of “Doorways to Hell”. These typically are doors that mysteriously show up in impossible locations or have an aura of evil surrounding it.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

The doorway acts as bolthole for the God-Machine’s inner workings. 

\*Security:\*

Each door has a key that is bound to it, typically in the possession of an Angel or Stigmatic. Any attempt to open the door without a key will result in the door staying in the closed state. Mortals who get feelings of discomfort as they get closer to the door.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The keyhole will give off small amounts of Aether while closed.

\*Linchpin:\*

Shimmying a specific type of store loyalty card to jimmy the lock will deactivate the effect. The door will become a normal door, but what it’s hiding will no longer be securely hidden. The door can be shut, but mortals will be able to open it from now on.

## Emergency Announcement

With the increase in cellphone use, emergency services have the ability to notify anyone with a phone about an emergency. The perfect way to keep people off the street.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

All cellphones within a certain radius receive an emergency alert on their phone telling them to stay inside due to inclimate weather. For the duration of the message all mortals will stay inside, allowing agents of the God-Machine to work unseen. Demons are unaffected, allowing Angels to use this to help track the Unchained. If used for too long mortals will eventually run out of food and die.

\*Security:\*

The emergency announcement system is typically in the form of a laptop attached to an antenna of some kind to transmit the message. A Messenger Angel typically operates the device and keeps it close by.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The antenna or cell tower will emit Aether for as long as the emergency is in effect. 

\*Linchpin:\*

Calling 911 on an affected phone will break the affect and disable the system permanently. It is an emergency failsafe. 

## Mystery Spot

The God-Machine’s matrices sometimes cause physics to take a lunch break. Such anomalies cause people to question why. Hence the Mystery Spot attraction, tourists come to see a cheesy tourist trap that distracts from the severity of the problem.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

The Mystery Spot is setup and run by a bored looking Simulacra that will charge people money to see “an unexplainable phenomenon”. Mortals are typically turned off by the idea, but those that aren’t believe it is an illusion. A fair few will be turned into Stigmatics by witnessing the inner workings of the God-Machine, but the Mystery Spot is designed to minimize such occurrences. 

\*Security:\*

Mystery Spots don’t have a lot of security. The simulacra doesn’t attack anyone who looks too closely, but will direct stigmatics to a “friend” who will explain what happened if it detects one is created.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

A broken ticket machine will expel aether at regular intervals since the infrastructure is always running.

\*Linchpin:\*

Spot Remover

# Defense Infrastructure:

\&gt;Means to protect an operation once it has been discovered. Again, the means of protection can vary: Sometimes, it is an ambush set up by the resident gang that have been informed by an anonymous source; at other times, it is a Destroyer Angel equipped with a flaming sword.

## Ear Piercing Alarm

In order to keep equipment secure security systems are embedded into vehicles and houses. The God-Machine has turned the volume to 11 to create a sonic weapon that will kill any person who tries to break in.

\*Type:\*

Defense

\*Function:\*

If lock is bypassed without proper clearance (i.e. key, badge, or passcode) the alarm will go off and cause massive injury to any being with working eardrums. The alarm is localized to the infrastructure it is protecting.

\*Security:\*

The alarm can be bypassed with the proper key, badge, or passcode depending on how it is configured. 

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Aether is released after any unauthorized lifeforms within its functional area are eliminated. This process occurs because it is trying to replenish its energy after its sonic attack.

\*Linchpin:\*

Plugging the speaker with earplugs.

## Elf on a Shelf

A toy elf that sits on a shelf and also reports any unusual behavior to the God-Machine. It knows when you’ve been good and it knows when you’ve interfered with its plans for the last time.

\*Type:\*

Defense

\*Function:\*

The toy elf is a Yuletide tradition that has a relatively new history. The God-Machine has bypassed the toy’s reporting to Santa Claus and is able to get minute to minute reports from the inanimate elf. The elf will report all information to the God-Machine’s agents. Typically an Angel with a Santa Claus cover. This is beneficial in surveillance and security situations..

\*Security:\*

The elf on the shelf can be remotely controlled to attack targets deemed threats to what it is watching over.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When the Elf uploads data to the God-Machine it excretes pine scented aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

Knocking the elf prone will cause it to break.

## Neighborhood Watch

When the police can’t be bothered the neighborhood watch is there to keep an eye out for trouble.

\*Type:\*

Defense

\*Function:\*

The neighborhood watch is a group of humans compelled to defend their street from “undesirables”. The members typically are able to rapidly communicate with one another as if via telepathy. Many are armed with weapons that are more akin to a private military than a group of PTA members.

\*Security:\*

If the group cannot contain the problem they will call the police, which may include stigmatics and an angel depending on the strategic value of the area being defended.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The sewer under the street contain aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

If the Neighborhood Watch sign is removed the residents will return to normal and not interfere with strangers entering their area.

## Deadly Curse

The deadly curse trope has been common in mummy fiction. The God-Machine took this idea and spun it around. This infrastructure is hidden within another piece of infrastructure. If someone without authorization tries to stop the occult matrix the curse will activate.

\*Type:\*

Defense

\*Function:\*

The curse comes in the form of a runic tattoo that is tied to the person who triggered it. This tattoo is persistent even when changing covers or in demon form. The curse itself will act as a beacon for angels as well as increase bad luck for the individual.

\*Security:\*

The curse is a parasite that latches onto a host. It acts as a red flag for the God-Machine to track as well as cause misforturne to the target. No mortal tattoo removal can permanently get rid of it.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The upside of the tattoo is that it is a portable aether store, giving the target either regenerating aether or aether storage if they are not a demon.

\*Linchpin:\*

The tattoo cannot be removed, but can be modified. If the target gets a tattoo over it the curse is removed.

# Logistical Infrastructure:

Means to locate, collect, and transport the equipment necessary for generating Output. Depending on the operation, these Infrastructures can vary a great deal, from ordinary metal gears to an ancient relic of a forgotten civilization.

## The House on the Hill

The history of the house is full of ghost stories and mysterious deaths.

\*Type:\*

Logistical

\*Function:\*

The house itself is infrastructure designed to create ghosts so that the God-Machine can repurpose the energy for its own use. Humans who live in the house will start be driven mad as the house sucks their lifeforce and sanity. 

\*Security:\*

The house becomes an anchor for multiple ghosts. These ghosts typically will defend the house to avoid being destroyed. The house can defend itself by causing hallucinations and sending out ghosts it nows will be able to protect it.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When a person dies inside the house a burst of aether from the chimney as the house converts the living energy into a ghost.

\*Linchpin:\*

The heart of the house is a single room covered in black mold. A fire inside that room will destroy the house and destroy any ghosts anchored to it. Getting to the room is nearly impossible as the house can divert sense those who wish to harm it.

## The Waiting Package

Often times a package is delivered and it waits... and waits. Never being picked up and never being delivered.

\*Type:\*

Logistical

\*Function:\*

The package is left outside of a house, but no one ever picks it up. At least no one who lives in the house. It is designed to be stolen. A thief searching for delivered packages will grab the box and take it to where they live. When the box is opened the thief will be exposed to the God-Machine’s inner workings, becoming a stigmatic. They will then leave the box outside their house for another thief to find and leave to join the God-Machine’s agents. 

\*Security:\*

The package is a brown cardboard box with a shipping label. The destination will always update to where it is left. Any attempt to destroy the package will cause it to return to where it was found.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When the box is opened aether is emitted. 

\*Linchpin:\*

Writing return to sender on the package will deactivate all infrastructure within it. Leaving behind an empty box.

## Family Entertainment Center

An arcade and pizza joint all in one. In the morning it is entertainment for the entire family, but being perceptive might peel back the facade. An Urban Legend states that the animatronics walk after dark looking for new playmates.

\*Type:\*

Logistical

\*Function:\*

The Family Entertainment Center is a facade that is used to create animatronic golems. These creatures are humans whose souls are bound into robotic shells. Typically those who accidentally stay past closing are the victims. These individuals are non-stigmatic workers or investigators that are allowed in by the God-Machine’s minions.

\*Security:\*

Stigmatics run the daily operations of the infrastructure. A Psychopomp leads them in making sure the concealment infrastructure is maintained and that newly made animatronics are shipped where they need to go. At night anyone inside will be unable to leave until the morning. The animatronics do not discriminate between Angel, Demon, or Mortal. They are only passive to other animatronics and children.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When a soul is anchored to an animatronic the pizza oven expels aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

A new animatronic must be created every seven days, if this does not occur the infrastructure will collapse from under use.

## Delivery Application

Need something delivered in an instant? Try the latest courier application. Get any item delivered to you no questions asked.

\*Type:\*

Logistical

\*Function:\*

The God-Machine has found the Gig Economy a simple way to supply the Angel on the go. Mortal drivers have packages containing various illegal and supernatural items. Many drivers are either mortals, stigmatics, or simulacra.

\*Security:\*

Packages are guarded by their courier, but the main security is the packaging. Packages are surrounded by “cardboard” that protects its contents from interaction with the outside world. The only person who can open the package is whoever’s name is marked as the recipient.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Phones using the app to request or navigate a delivery give off aether..

\*Linchpin:\*

Giving the application a non-5 star review on the app store will cause the application to be deleted.

# Elimination Infrastructure:

Means to eliminate all evidence once the desired result is achieved. The method of elimination can be as crude as acts of arson or demolitions or as subtle as a loyal wizard or spirit that causes the entire town to forget.

## Empty Grave

A six foot deep hole that is completely empty. Near it is a blank headstone.

\*Type:\*

Elimination

\*Function:\*

When a person enters the hole it begins to fill with dirt, burying the victim alive. Once the hole is completely filled the victim’s information fills the headstone.

\*Security:\*

None. Not even a railing. 

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The earth around the hole excretes aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

Placing a pepperoni pizza on the tombstone will destroy the empty grave and the victim will return to the surface. Note that the victim may have died from suffocate in the intervening time.

## Vintage Video Game

No one knows exactly why the video game was created, but what is known is that those who play it die in horrible ways. The video game on a form of media, such as a DVD or cartridge.

\*Type:\*

Elimination

\*Function:\*

When a player starts the game their mind will begin to deteriorate until they become comatose, die, or their mind is so damaged that they become insane.

\*Security:\*

The game media itself cannot be physically destroyed. Any attempt will result in the video game appearing inside the next compatible console/computer that the person who destroyed it uses. Additionally after the video game finishes off a player it will be sold off by the player’s family in an estate sale.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When the computer or console playing the game its power supply will give off aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

Exposing the game media to a magnet will erase all game data. 

## Collectible Card Game

When a person becomes too curious or obsessed the God-Machine introduces them to a compulsion to keep their attention away from its inner workings. And thus the “Angels and Demons: Trading Card Game” was created.

\*Type:\*

Elimination

\*Function:\*

The appearance of the cards are simple thick paper cards with fantasy artwork. In actuality the cards have an addictive “got to collect them all” coating them. Anyone who opens a booster pack full of these cards is at risk to become obsessed, spending all their money to become “the best”. Victims have been known to destroy their entire life and bank accounts in order to get more and more cards.

\*Security:\*

The card game is for kids ages 12 and up. 

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The cards in the discard pile produce aether whenever a game is played.

\*Linchpin:\*

The card game loses its hold over a person if every card the collector owns is shredded.

## Haunted Jewelry

Sometimes a person needs to have the fear of the God-Machine put into them. The God-Machine needs to eliminate a target by making them too scared to act. Thus this infrastructure will create “ghosts” to haunt a target until they are too scared to function.

\*Type:\*

Elimination

\*Function:\*

The actual infrastructure is an innocuous object such as a piece of jewelry. A victim will find themselves haunted by the ghosts of those they knew who died. The ghosts are not traditional ghosts and in fact are more akin to spirits than actual ghosts, but their forms have been overwritten by the God-Machine. These “ghosts” will try to tear away at the victim’s sanity, if that doesn’t work they will resort to murder.

\*Security:\*

Normal mortals won’t recognize the danger of the jewelry, unless someone points out that all the haunting started when they started wearing the jewelry. If someone tries to remove the jewelry with the intent to stop the haunting, the jewelry will constrict until it is impossible to remove. Further tampering could result in the jewelry strangling or cutting off circulation to the limb its attached to.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When a haunting is occurring the jewelry will emit aether. 

\*Linchpin:\*

Causing the metal of the jewelry to be tarnished will cause the jewelry to fall apart and lose its properties.

# Command and Control:

The central unit that directs the operation and coordinates the various factors that eventually lead to the creation of the matrix. A Command and Control Infrastructure has never been observed, but there are rumors among the Unchained that by altering one of these Infrastructures, the plans of the God-Machine can be severely set back.

## Think Tank

The God-Machine knows how dangerous it can be to give one person complete power. Thus the Think Tank was created, a group of individuals who can act as checks and balances for its Occult Matrix. The individuals don’t know how their decisions are carried out, but they will be given a goal and figure out what needs to happen to reach it. Perhaps a politician needs to be replaced, the Think Tank members tell an Angel who will then designate the proper course of action. Either by killing the individual literally or setting dominos in motion to destroy the politician’s career.

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

The Think Tank consists of four members. Each member is significantly different than the others and all four need to be present within the Think Tank building for the Command and Control Infrastructure to operate. The members can be replaced if the stress of the Infrastructure causes them too much stress or if they go rogue, usually this results in a trip to a God-Machine controlled psych ward. The building is the housing unit of the Infrastructure, but the humans are like the computer RAM. 

When the people have consensus on an issue a Messenger Angel will take their decision and then delegate the task to other agents of the God-Machine. 

\*Security:\*

The Security team is run by Stigmatics and Angels who are prepared to evacuate the building at the first signs of infiltration.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The Think Tank’s generates so much aether that it is disposed via the city’s sewage line.

\*Linchpin:\*

Killing a member of the Think Tank while it is in session will cause a cascading failure throughout the Infrastructure, making it completely inoperable. It took decades to get the Think Tank Infrastructure working, and will take decades for the Angels to rebuild it.

## The Four Prophecies

This Command and Control Infrastructure is based on communicating with various spirits. Any message that is delivered four times in the exact phrasing is considered a confirmed God-Machine edict.

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

The key pieces of the Infrastructure are a ouija board, a deck of tarot cards, crystal ball, and tea leaves. On their own these items would be too mundane to get anything close to the God-Machine’s messages. But when given to clairvoyant humans the Infrastructure is active. None of the humans know the true purpose of these messages, but the angels have agents observing these people and reporting what is said.

\*Security:\*

Each psychic is separated from one another and has a frequent customer who is in fact an agent of the God-Machine. 

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Whenever the prophecy is repeated for the fourth and last time, aether is expelled from the items.

\*Linchpin:\*

Killing a psychic will not end the Infrastructure, the Angels can just give the devices to other psychics. The Infrastructure can be disrupted if one of the devices is stolen, but could result in the Angels relying on prophecies that are repeated 3 times instead of 4. To completely destroy the Infrastructure all four items must be in the same location.

## Bistro-Mathmatics

Douglas Adams once wrote a book that posited that restaurant bills do not follow the laws of mathematics. The God-Machine realized this as well and created the Bistro-Mathmatics engine, a restaurant that could calculate the proper course of action to take.

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

The restaurant is a high scale bistro with customers who always seem to be busy in conversation. The staff as well as busy with their work. However, the owner looks out to the bistro and sees the workings of the God-Machine, taking notes and sending them to the God-Machine’s agents in order to carry out the God-Machine’s will. All who are trapped in the bistro’s calculations are forever stuck in place, unable to leave. If a person dies they are replaced with a new guest.

\*Security:\*

All of the restaurant guests are mortals, but the staff are stigmatics or simulacra who will try to remove those who aren’t on the guest list. The restaurant’s guest list is always full and they do not take reservations.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The dumpster outside the restaurant is full of aether and gets cleaned out on a weekly basis.

\*Linchpin:\*

Replacing the health inspection sign from an A to an F will result in the restaurant being flooded with rats, causing all the guests to leave and dismantling the Infrastructure completely.

## Blood Stone Circle

The Blood Stone Circle was created by the God-Machine to interpret it’s will in remote areas. The stones are covered in ancient writing and sometimes sprout cults around them.

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

The Blood Stone Circle can be as big as the God-Machine wills it. The only stipulation is that they have to be equidistant from one another. Human blood must be spilled on each stone pillar simultaneously in order to receive the command of the God-Machine. The ancient rituals that cultists perform are not necessary, one pint of animal blood smeared on the stone will suffice. But that doesn’t stop cults from performing virgin sacrifices to the dark gods on them.

\*Security:\*

The stone pillars are easily hidden and in some cases stigmatic cults form around them. Cultists will protect the stone pillars from any harm. Angels will sometimes become cult figure heads in order to keep a close eye.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The Blood Stone Circle creates a pool of aether in the center of the circle. 

\*Linchpin:\*

If holy water is sprinkled on each stone pillar simultaneously the pillars will crumble.

Just sent our my application for a Dominos. As Deliveroo and Uber Eats need 1000 documentation and a photo ID which all I have is my old passport.

Wondering who works for them and what t is like. For a cyclist
Teaching on the global spread of Christianity during the age of exploration has brought me to the papal bull *Inter Caetera*.  In it Pope Alexander VI formally recognized Spain's (Castile/Leon) temporal claims to certain discovered lands, while insisting on their obligation to further the Christian religion under the Church's guidance. Here are some excerpts: 

Main topic, the promulgation of Christianity

&gt; Inter cetera Divine Majestati beneplacita opera et cordis nostri desiderabilia, illud profecto potissimum existit, ut fides Catholica et Christiana religio nostris presertim temporibus exaltetur, ac ubilibet amplietur et dilatetur, animarumque salus procuretur, ac barbare nationes deprimantur et ad fidem ipsam reducantur. 

Promulgation of Christianity delayed by, and continuous with (?), the Reconquista 

&gt; Sane accepimus quod vos, qui dudum animo proposueratis aliquas insulas et terras firmas, remotas et incognitas ac per alios hactenus non repertas, querere et invenire, ut illarum incolas et habitatores ad colendum Redemptorem nostrum et fidem Catholicam profitendum reduceretis, hactenus in expugnatione et recuperatione ipsius regni Granate plurimum occupati, hujusmodi sanctum et laudabile propositum vestrum ad optatum finem perducere nequivistis...

Praise for Columbus

&gt; sed tandem, sicut Domino placuit, regno predicto recuperato, volentes desiderium adimplere vestrum, dilectum filium Cristophorum Colon, virum utique dignum et plurimum commendandum, ac tanto negotio aptum, cum navigiis et hominibus ad similia instructis, non sine maximis laboribus et periculis ac expensis, destinastis, ut terras firmas et insulas remotas et incognitas hujusmodi per mare, ubi hactenus navigatum non fuerat, diligenter inquireret; qui tandem, divino auxilio, facta extrema diligentia, in mari oceano navigantes, certas insulas remotissimas, et etiam terras firmas, que per alios hactenus reperte non fuerant, invenerunt ...

Description of natives and need for their conversion

&gt; in quibus quamplurime gentes, pacifice viventes, et, ut asseritur, nudi incedentes, nec carnibus vescentes, inhabitant ; et, ut prefati nuntii vestri possunt opinari, gentes ipse in insulis et terris predictis habitantes credunt unum Deum Creatorem in celis esse, ac ad fidem Catholicam amplexandum et bonis moribus imbuendum satis apti videntur, spesque habetur quod, si erudirentur, nomen Salvatoris, Domini nostri Jhesu Christi, in terris et insulis predictis facile induceretur;

Recognition that religious conversions had already begun 

&gt; Unde omnibus diligenter, et presertim fidei Catholice exaltatione et dilatatione, prout decet Catholicos reges et principes, consideratis, more progenitorum vestrorum, clare memorie regum, terras firmas et insulas predictas illarumque incolas et habitatores, vobis, divina favente clementia, subjicere et ad fidem Catholicam reducere proposuistis. 

Charge to continue

&gt; Requirimus ut cum ... populos in hujusmodi insulis et terris degentes ad Christianam religionem suscipiendam inducere velitis et debeatis, nec pericula, nec labores ullo unquam tempore vos deterreant, firma spe fiduciaque conceptis, quod Deus Omnipotens conatus vestros feliciter prosequetur. 

Grant of lands based on a longitudinal line, forerunner to Treaty of Tordesillas

&gt;... de nostra mera liberalitate et ex certa scientia ac de apostolice potestatis plenitudine, omnes insulas et terras firmas inventas et inveniendas, detectas et detegendas versus occidentem et meridiem fabricando et constituendo unam lineam a polo Arctico scilicet septentrione ad polum Antarcticum scilicet meridiem, sive terre firme et insule invente et inveniende sint versus Indiam aut versus aliam quancunque partem, que linea distet a qualibet insularum, que vulgariter nuncupantur de los Azores et Caboverde, centum leucis versus occidentem et meridiem ...  quando fuerunt per nuntios et capitaneos vestros invente alique predictarum insularum, auctoritate Omnipotentis Dei nobis in beato Petro concessa, ac vicariatus Jhesu Christi, qua fungimur in terris, cum omnibus illarum dominiis, civitatibus, castris, locis et villis, juribusque et jurisdictionibus ac pertinentiis universis, vobis heredibusque et successoribus vestris, Castelle et Legionis regibus, in perpetuum tenore presentium donamus, concedimus, et assignamus, vosque et heredes ac successores prefatos illarum dominos cum plena, libera, et omnimoda potestate, auctoritate, et jurisdictione, facimus, constituimus, et deputamus. 

Qualification, this doesn't apply to territories already possessed by other Christian princes

Alien ship that looks like a huge all black domino hovers like, 10ft off the ground while draining energy from the sun...threatening to destroy the Earth in the process. A scientist suspect the aliens do not know that humans are advanced enough to be worth saving. He tries to get the governments to communicate through math, but they don't listen and use a sampling of languages from around the Earth. This results in the aliens "hacking" all our interwebs to try to decipher the message and accidentally cause all airplanes to fall from the sky.

The book is written in English, but I thought the title was Latin or something...

Thank you!
Every Friday at any time of day send a picture of your pizza.

Wether it’s  10 day old dominoes
Or gourmet pizza from the finest New York establishments.

Reddit Pizza Party.
I just watched a horrifying video from Winchester Dairy undercover (dairy supplier to Leprino Foods; Pizza Hut, Domino’s, and Papa John’s) . The hidden-camera video shows enraged psychopaths torturing the cows. 

 [http://www.gotmisery.com/readmore.php](http://www.gotmisery.com/readmore.php) 

Pizza was my all-time favorite, it was my "if you could only take one thing to a deserted island what would you take" thing.

The Winchester footage just took me down. I'm feeling so ashamed that I didn't look into this earlier in my life. I'm only 90 days vegan. I've been supporting this horrible industry for so many years. My heart aches.
Well, the media companies had me for awhile. I have a tolerance level that balance between cost and convenience. I’ll *pay* for convenience, but I have a limit. Disney+ was that limit.

Why in the fuck would I subscribe to that service right now? They have *one* show I want to see. One. Eventually they’ll have quite a bit I want to see, but that’s quite awhile away.

Luckily I know how to sail these seas. Usenet? Easy. I still have unlimited access from a deal I bought years ago. 8 years retention, 100 connections for like $5 a year. I’ve always kept it “just in case.” Oh, and torrents? I’ve used a VPN for years. I’m prepared and it will be smooth sailing.

The thing is, once I get started, it will be just as convenient as streaming, so all media companies may lose out its like dominos. These stupid ass greedy companies. They should have worked it out and now they lose out. I’m not the only one like this. A couple of friends had the same thoughts.



I'm a fairly recent Vet, i got out back in Mrach, and well its been a ride, I've learned almost as much in the past 8 months as my entire 8 year stint in the Navy. Toward the end of my time in was spent limdu after an injury and was spent fairly miserably with a lost sense of direction and failed leadership.

While i wont sit here and bash the leadership, it seems the term, "leave it better than the way you found it" only applys to a physical place any longer. Engage with your sailors, train them, and encourage them to be better than you are.  You never know what kind of domino effect you might start.

Also if you're intending on getting out, do your research, take TGPS twice, whether you are limdu or not take TDAP (its a no orders walk in class at the hospital, so you can get info on the VA claims process). Ensure you have a resume ready to go. Use every resource available ti you, youve earned it.
So I recently (literally about two hours ago) ordered something on Postmates. Just some simple breakfast from a place only about two miles away. Didn't feel like driving and I have a lot of work to do, so I figured this convenience of order would be pretty nice.

Order my food and delivery is estimated at around... half an hour. This isn't the first time I've ordered from there, and it's kind of just routine for when the workload gets a little bigger on Tuesday, so the times vary and I don't mind that.

Eventually (about half an hour later) my order gets picked up. Awesome. Ten minutes and I'll have it.

Twenty-five minutes pass and I get the notification that "so and so is nearby, contact them to collect your order" so I look and... this delivery driver is two streets over at a completely separate Apartment Complex.

So I contact him via text, ask him if he wants directions because he isn't in the right spot, and I can meet him outside if he needs it.

No reply.

His little car starts moving though. This time, he drives to a nearby Outlet Mall and parks for about ten minutes.

I try to call and there's no answer, like hung up.

So at this point I'm just like alright, what is this guy even doing?

He goes up the opposite street, back down, back to the other apartment complex, back to the outlet mall and finally after ten minutes - turns into my apartment complex. I swear... it isn't that hard to find, guys.

So I was just happy that the guy finally managed to find me. Yay, right?

He parks on the furthest end of the apartment complex, which isn't gated or guarded or anything.

I wait and wait and wait... knock, knock. There's my food. 

He has a map with my place circled. He went to the office of the apartment complex to ask where my apartment was and walked all the way here. He walked. There's plenty of open parking not ten feet from my building.

So he looks pretty upset and I just say thank you yadda yadda typical awkward exchange. And he says this snippet of. "Jesus christ..." and like a curse under his breath while he leaves.

I've driven for and ordered from postmates dozens upon dozens of times before, and nobody has ever had an issue finding where I'm at.

So here's my issue: I clearly tried to contact this dude multiple times, I could've met him on the street or helped him figure out where he was going. He was a pretty... elderly guy, and I'm just assuming that not all the pieces were there, if you know what I mean. But my ten-fifteen minute delivery turned into an hour, and all my stuff is cold at this point.

Now normally I'd think, "Yeah but it was an hour of his time too" but... it didn't have to be, if he just contacted me, or replied. He literally wasted his own time, instead of just answering my phone call.

**So should I even tip this guy?** Typically at this time, for this delivery, I shell out 5+ dollars even though the order is only 11.00. I don't mind, I like tipping. But this...

I leaning towards the absolute minimum 20% but this is the first time, literally the first time ever since using any delivery service, even dominos, that I've considered not tipping... because holy crap: just. call. me. I'm not crazy for this, right?
Heya! I'm Jayme. Currently waiting for the slowest Dominos delivery driver in existence to bring me my food so hey, what a better time to make a new friend!

It's my birthday, turning 22 today. Weird to type it out. I'm from Ireland and I work in I.T for the Irish government. I have hobbies and interests in a bit of everything, from psychology to fashion to history to photography. Whatever interests me on the day! I also suck at typing about myself but I love to learn about other people and their walks of lives. It's fascinating to me.

PM me your top 3 pizza toppings!
When she opens and sees my car is still here. I’m gonna have to sleep here because nobody gave me a key lol
This is obviously just my preference so you are most likely going to disagree with many positions. How far your mains got in my list? 


**20. Yegor**
Old man in tracksuit looking outfit. Just doesn't look like he belongs.

**19. Grintch**
Annoying to play against. Hardest operator to see. Outfit doesn't look good either. 

**18. Charly**
Extremely popular. Half the coalition is usually Charly, which just makes me dislike seeing her more. I don't get it. Looks more like a principle than a soldier. 

**17. Golem**
Coalition Grintch. Haven't seen him as much to be as annoying. 

**16. Syd**
 She kinda looks fake. Idk that's probably just me. 

**15. Otter**
Cool face paint but meh. 

**14. Minotaur**
Cartoonish. Name doesn't help. Striped shirt looks awful. 

**13. D-day**
Gun nut from Texas. Pretty cool. 

**12. Rodion**
Got better position over Minotaur and D-day because of the helmet. Would look much better with long sleeves or t-shirt

**11. Alice**
Solid. Haven't seen her much. 

**10. Coalition default**
Uniform not that good looking. There's one masked guy in rotation who looks nice. 

**9. Azur**
I really like the look of him. Realistic.

**8. Zane**
Coolness overload. Best fashion sense of the bunch. 

**7. Raines**
Unfortunately quite rare sight. 

**6. Thorne**
Cool looking realistic soldier. 

**5. Domino**
Easily best female operator. Amazing look. Her finishing move is a thing of beauty. 

**4. Wyatt**
Reminds me of original Gaz. That's enough to like him. 

**3. Bale** 
I sometimes use Bale but he has just bit of goofiness compared to number 1 and 2. Overall love Bale.

**2. Krueger**
Badass. Looks absolutely sick. When facing three of those at the same time it can be scary compared to facing three minotaurs for example. So this operator doesn't kill any immersions even if many people would be using him. Has an amazing finishing move. 

**1. Allegiance default**
These cold blooded spetsnaz soldiers are realest and coolest. Especially the masked ones. Throwback to MW2 spetsnaz. Best faction in cod history.
For years I have always wondered what this is actually evidence of? It’s a holotape that has him saying “pretty as a picture”....are they Vera Keys nudes or something? He kept her in check with Med-X I thought.....or was she just self-medicating to cope with the whole Sinclair vs Dean mess....
my top one is Neyo, but i also really want want Bacara, Gregor, Keeli, Thire, Fives, Echo, Appo, Kix, Hardcase, along with single releases of the 501st and 212th troopers, a Galactic Marine, 187th, 332nd, 41st (revenge of the sith camo version), Clone Shock Trooper, and Domino Squad.

There's so much left to implement. I can't sell horses, carriages, I can't rob trains, I can't play mini-games like poker or domino. Do they have plans to implement more stuff so that being an outlaw is worth it? I was so disappointed after stealing a carriage and trying to sell it to a fence only for it to not open the door.
I posted some time ago about leaving good reviews via the Dominos app (which I still do). I was wondering what a good tip is for drivers? Tonight I had a free pizza thanks to my app and the delivery fee was $3 which I had no issue with. I felt generous plus the dude was really quick and polite. He went out of his way to bring extra napkins and stuff. I gave him a $5 tip just due to all that. He was very thankful and actually pretty surprised it seemed. I've heard of drivers getting just a dollar or two which I think is just a slap in the face considering how much gas is and sometimes no tip at all. So Domino's drivers: what's a good cash tip?

I have a little of everything for sale here. Take your pick and shoot me any questions. Shipping is $4 for one pop and an additional $2 for each pop after. More pics can be provided. Soft protectors can be added for $1

Why you do this? Yeah, I'm talking to you with those dry ass lips. DON'T YOU EVEN TRY TO LICK EM IT'S TOO LATE. Now listen, I'll forgive you and that desert you call a mouth only if you buy some comics. Unless you want me to get Timmy Two Shines to moisturize your lips...yeah didn't think so. I lowered down the prices a good amount just to help those dehydrated hunks of beef jerky on your face, pray I don't have to alter the deal further.

As Always....PICTURES WILL BE POSTED UPON REQUESTING EM 

Gonna list off the one omni and CGC slab I got just to get it over with and jump right to the nitty gritty.

Uncanny Avengers w/ Axis HC = $70

New Avengers #11 (9.8) = $115 with shipping

Edit: I'm pretty sure the books title had the word phantom in it.

A fiction book. A girl (I think called Sarah??) and her hardworking mother move house with the girls horse, I think was named Sunny. They move to a house close to a woods where the girl rides her horse, and meets a girl called Bess/Beth and her horse Domino.

Bess/Beth stops Sunny from running out of the words, after being spooked by a fire which seemed to come out of nowhere, onto a busy road when the millennia gate which was there moments ago has vanished.

Sarah? says to Bess/Beth how she's having trouble paying for Sunny's keep. Bess/Beth tells Sarah? about a nice 'young' couple who own a farm close by who could help. Sarah? leaves the farm and the next day? goes to the farm but the couple there are an older couple.
They agree to help and Sarah? starts working at the farm, I think the stablehand is called Dylan.

In the end it turns out Bess/Beth and Domino actually died in a barn fire years and years ago after it caught fire and they died when Bess/Beth tried to save Domino.

A main sentence was one night after Sarah finds this out, she's gotta to bed and says something along the lines of, "I'll be there to help you, day or night."

She wakes up in the middle of the night and knows Bess/Beth needs her help. So she runs into the woods and finds the same barn fire, like it was years before and saves Bess/Beth and Domino. And the next day back in present time, Bess/Beth is alive because of Sarah's? intervention in the past

[Emergency! intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMo3rvYKRWI&amp;feature=emb_logo)
Curious to see what other drivers do when it snows, the previous 2 years I’ve driven in the snow have not been fun, thankfully it doesn’t snow much down south if it all like it did when I lived up north. Last year I drove in the snow and almost slid off the road down a ditch, went back to the store and took myself of the road to which I got “Are you refusing to close” and threatened to be fired, about an hour later they shut down the store because it got so bad. Thankfully I put myself in good situation where if it snows and I get threatened again I won’t have to worry much but i’ve always been curious how other drivers do it, do you guys call out or just stay inside?
I know that Domino's does accept dining dollars. Are there any other restaurants that do something similar? Thanks!
Love this knife but I need some money and this is a knife I know I'll never use beyond looking at it and maybe opening a letter here or there. Pics taken with the Domino because I was hoping to sell that too but need my flair. Let me know if I need to update the timestamp again, I took them yesterday and was hoping to get a response in the price check thread, but I guess I'll have a go at pricing solo.

1: Fix the camp spawning glitch its a really big issue and should have been fixed months ago.                                                               2: Ability cards need an adjustment the damage reduction perks are absolutely insane and function as a god mode at this point.                                                                           3: Tonics also need an adjustment they either need to be much harder to make or much less effective. Also a limit to how many you can carry I was in a battle with some one who went through 70 tonics in one gunfight and I was basically powerless.       4: Role outfits should have been customizable from the start give us the individual pieces and let us buy bandoliers and satchels to increase ammo capacity and carry weight. Also bandoliers should be able to hold actual ammo like in the main game.                                                                5: Make camp matter more. It still feels so lifeless unless you have tons of friends. More varied npcs that you can pick up throughout the world would be an interesting addition and make the camp more alive.                                                                 6: A little issue but an annoying one, when I equip a different knife please let it stay equipped right now it constantly switches back to the base knife.                                            7:Fight clubs people have been holding their own for months and it needs to be a dedicated mode.                                                      8:While in camp I should not be able to be sniped from across the map.                               9:I know not a lot are fans of PVP and with the unbalanced nature it is understandable. Cardless pvp should be an option.                                                                        10: More maps for pvp. Right now it feels like there are only a handful that are repeated a lot. No Armadillo shootouts, come on.                                                                      11:The option to create different preset gang outfits for your posse. As it sits now there are only two which are super lame.          12: whenever I turn in a bounty I would like it if my weapons would not start to sag off my character.                                                           13: More pass time games like dominos, liars dice and five finger filet.                                14:More incentives for high level players once you get to a certain point the leveling system becomes redundant and you don’t get anything besides a treasure map every 5 levels.                                                                        15: Posse Events where you can take your gang into different modes to battle other gangs.   This is just stuff that came off the top of my head if anyone has any other ideas

**NOTE: By initiating a traded with me, you agree that you have read and agree to [my Terms Of Trade](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fishering/comments/diuuir/ufisherings_terms_of_trade/).**
My mother decided two days ago to cook soup for tonight’s dinner. I don’t like soup. I don’t like soup, stews, casseroles, I don’t like them. I never, ever have. And she knows this. So I told her I’d probably order in takeout. I asked if this was okay. She said yes. She offered earlier to do me sausage and mash, yet another dinner I’ve had over and over recently. I said no, that I was ordering in. 
So we get to tonight; she was already pissy because my brother’s therapist called so she had to wait to have her dinner. Mine arrived, and she saw I’d ordered dominoes pizza. I ordered it because I had coupons, and was therefore significantly cheaper. And she immediately got upset, asking why I’d ordered pizza when I don’t like the frozen pizzas she buys. I explained I don’t like the fact they always go soggy when she cooks them. Fine. Then she got upset while we were eating. Me eating takeout, with money I earned from my job I work my ass off at every single weekend (juggling it with full time education; not easy), because she cooked a meal I’ve hated openly since childhood. Apparently it’s insensitive because she’d love to go out on a Saturday night and end the evening with a Chinese takeout but she can’t as she has no money. It ended with her basically telling me that I’m being selfish, and not thinking of her, and how she feels. I asked her to get me some cocodamol (£3.20) three weeks ago, a few days before payday, as I deal with chronic migraines and had a bad one and no medication. I had no pills. I said I’d pay her back. She said not to bother. 

She’s recently very into guilting and emotionally manipulating me, background information that hopefully adds more context into why I don’t think I’m 100% in the wrong. For reference, I also buy my own things as often as possible. I pay for my phone bills, phone, clothes, (usually) medication, takeout when we have it as a family (maybe once every few months), school supplies, I’m currently paying my own travel expenses as my sixth form cut my bus pass as they’ve changed the system, leaving me with no way to get home. I contribute to the petrol bill every month because she drives me to work as I don’t drive myself as I’m busy trying to afford everything else. I’m also trying to save up for my exams I need to take to hopefully get into an American university, art supplies (sounds irrelevant but it’s really not; she’s pushing me into commissions), and saving for the ACT practice guide and everything. Then of course my passport, ID, Application fees and everything else. She’s against me going to uni in America because “she won’t get to see me”. I’m being told in the victim of “emotion incest”; a form of codependency. Her guilting is just one of the aspects I have to deal with. 

Please help me understand if I’m the asshole, as I’m truly stuck as to whether or not I’m really in the wrong.

Hello! So, last saturday I adopted my second cat. Her name is Sage, she's one year and one month. My first cat, Domino, is two years and two months old and she does not like the new addition. I live in a studio, so I've been keeping Sage in my bathroom, but that being said it was near impossible to keep them from seeing each other, and everytime Domino has her eyes on Sage, she starts hissing pretty hardcore. 

I tried the tactic where they eat on opposite sides of the door, but Domino won't even go near the food dish even if I opt to use treats, she isn't very food motivated. Then I was also trying the blanket technique where you take a blanket or towel with one cat's sent, then let the other sniff it, etc. That seemed to calm Domino down, but the moment she got even a glance at Sage she would go back to hissing and being aggressive. 

The big mistake I feel like I made was letting Sage explore my apartment after making it well known she was tired of being stuck in the bathroom while Domino hid in my loft, which is accessible by a ladder. I thought it was going to be alright because Domino's hissing actually seemed to calm down, but then she lunged in for a fight and this is where we are, back to square one. While Sage is in the bathroom, though, Domino is perfectly fine like there isn't another cat in the apartment. 

Sorry for the long ramble, I'm just frustrated with mostly myself because even though I'm aware this is very early on and this stuff takes a long time and a lot of patience, Domino seems to be rejecting a lot of the usual go-to tactics of introduction and that one incident seemed to really set up backwards (I fully blame myself for that one). I do have a Feliway diffuser coming in the mail tonight so I'm hoping that helps a lot. 

So, tl;dr: if anyone has any really handy tips to some more advice on how to RE-introduce cats, I'd greatly appreciate it. I love cats, I've always known I was going to have two one day, and they're both such nice cats. I guess I'm just eager to get them to the point of tolerating each other, haha.
 There is a place. A place that knows no sadness. Where even feeling blue is a happy thing. A place inhabited by little blue beings three apples high. It lies deep in an enchanted forest, hidden away beyond a medieval village. Most people believe this place is made up, only to be found in books or in children's imaginations. Well, we beg to differ. Yeah! Come on, Farmer! I'm going in! All right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you! Yes! Whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly! Oh, yeah! So excited! Now you see us, now you don't! Three, two, one. Yeah! Yeah! I love smurf berries! Hey, hey! The blue ones are mine! Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal! I am so late! In Smurf village, each and every Smurf plays their own special pad. - Whoa, Nellie! - Sorry, Handy! No problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed! Which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony. - Hey, Baker! Nice pies! - No worries, Clumsy. - And tranquility. - Great sign, guys! - Whether it's Handy Smurf the builder - I can't stay. Rehearsal time! - Baker Smurf. - Hey, Narrator Smurf! Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro for the Blue Moon Festival! - Pizza! - Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf! Clumsy! Help! I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius! Smurf on the loose! - Hey, Clumsy. - Hey, guys! - Hi, Jokey! - Hi, Clumsy. Who's clumsy now, huh? Hey, what do you get when you cross a Smurf with a cow? Blue cheese! I got you a present. No, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal! But, wait! I... Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor. Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal for the Blue Moon Festival? What can I say, Clumsy? You're not on the list. Grouchy, it's right there. Right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy." Clearly you two lack the verbal skills required - to explain this predicament succinctly. - Hey! - Here we go. - You see, Clumsy, the other Smurfs don't want to dance with you for fear of what are politely called "fractures." How could anybody think that? That's gonna leave a big blue bruise. Wonderful! Beautiful! Marvelous. Watch it, there! Cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes. - A worry line! - All right, don't get your petals in a twist. As happy and as perfect as life in Smurf village is, even sunshine and butterflies must have their dark clouds. And for all Smurfs, that dark cloud has one name. Gargamel, the evil wizard. La la la la la la Sing a happy song La la la la la la This is so wrong "I'm Papa Smurf. "I'm the head of a small group of blue people "and live in the forest with 99 sons and one daughter. "Nothing weird about that, no, no. Totally normal." "Oh, and I'm Smurfette. And I think I'm so pretty. "And I betrayed Gargamel, and I don't even care. "And everything is just sunshine and rainbows." But all of that is about to change. I said, "All of that is about to change." Azrael, that's your cue! That's your cue to pounce on the miserable beasts in some kind of a rage-induced feline frenzy. Yes, good. Yeah. More rage. Hey, but don't go crazy. These are the only puppets I have. I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you. I simply can't stop thinking about the miserable beasts every single minute of every single day. 'Cause I need them! It is only by capturing the little wretches and extracting their happy blue essence that my magic will finally become... Not infallible. Invincible! Yes. Thank you. I shall become the most powerful wizard in all of the world. Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it. "O great one?" Yes, lying, deceptive, horrible little Smurfette? "After all your years of Smurf-less searching, how ever do you expect to find us?" I'm very glad you asked, my dear. For, you see, I have a magical map that shows me exactly where the smurf root grows! I shall now use my formidable powers to magically transport us here! Come, my little fish-breathed friend! Alakazoop! Great. Ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy? We really need that Smurf essence. Alakazamp! Now tie it off right there!

In the Spirit of Inktober, the challenge is to create a piece of art within that day. Below, there's a list of X-men character prompts. You can do pencil, ink, paint, digital, fanfic, custom action figures, or whatever you'd like. Get to a place where you feel your piece of art is finished, and then share it with your X-Men community, wether that's a Discord, Reddit, Twitter, or just posting it on your fridge.

The list of characters is sourced from Jordan D White's [poll of favorite X-Men Characters] (https://twitter.com/cracksh0t/status/1046735433487601664?s=20) plus a few favorites from the podcast Jay &amp; Miles X-Plain the X-Men. 

You don't have to do every day, but it's fun to try!

Hope you survive the experience!

Heya! I'm Jayme. Currently waiting for the slowest Dominos delivery driver in existence to bring me my food so hey, what a better time to make a new friend!

It's my birthday, turning 22 today. Weird to type it out. I'm from Ireland and I work in I.T for the Irish government. I have hobbies and interests in a bit of everything, from psychology to fashion to history to photography. Whatever interests me on the day! I also suck at typing about myself but I love to learn about other people and their walks of lives. It's fascinating to me.

PM me your top 3 pizza toppings!
I want to make a breakfast pizza which basically consists of the base (dough), eggs, and sausage+bacon+cheese. I don't have a recipe yet...
So I  bought my f850gsa last month and since I changed some configurations the local dealer doesn't have any on stock. A  new one has to come from bmw.

In the last few days I've kind of been wondering about the entire build process. I saw a couple of videos on YouTube but nothing very enlightening.

My biggest question was, how long does it actually take to build one unit ...

Does anyone know ?

BMW if your out there it would be kind of cool yo have step by step follow through, like if you where ordering dominos !

Your motorcycle is in the oven ...
The picture on our order tracking thing was of a delicious hawaiin pizza with plenty of pineapple and meat.. The one we got barely had one bit of meat per slice.

Hi all,

 I know it hasn't been long since I was here last, but I can't post on RAOP with this account yet. I am registered but if you need proof I understand. Been homeless for a bit now but on a waiting list for subsidized housing. Keeping my fingers crossed for before the cold snap.

Any cheap pizza would be so super amazing. Getting tired of sardines. Dominos is not far from me.

Best to you all.

 https://joinfluz.app.link/MARKOE67798E93

the roommate and i were on the phone with dominos ordering a pizza when we heard some screaming and the guy on the phone said “oh um sorry we won’t be able to make your pizza a car just drove into our lobby. there is glass everywhere” so we didn’t get a pizza
Shipping is $6 for the first 3 books and $8 for 4-7 books.  Willing to consider deals for multiple books, so it doesn't hurt to ask.  Let me know if you have questions.

Fellow Domino's employees what are some tasty vegetarian food options here I've recently started to try and cut out meat as much as possible and I wanted to know any good suggestion on food.
I know the title is really confusing. It’s kinda hard to describe. It’s a bunch of small wood pieces, similar in shape to dominoes. They are all attached to each other on one string, like Christmas lights. When you flip one at the top over, all the others flip over too. Or something like that. I remember playing with when I was younger.
Took a Blue Domino with 4 friends, boutta be a night!!

Hello, I have some blue dominos, (about 2 points a pill) going to take some with some friends tomorrow, I have a single dab, I was planning on taking a pill, waiting about an hour or so tell it full kicks in, hit the dab through a honey badger, wait another hour, take another half pill, wait tell the comedown of the last half pill and smoke just bud

Along with this I have 0 tolerance to weed right now, haven't been able to smoke in a few months because of legal issues, however I have been taking alot of psychedelics during this time because they dont show up on drug tests, I've noticed LSD and Shrooms have made wax almost like a low grade psychedelic so I'm going mixing this in with the peak of a molly trip with cause the molly to be more psychedelic thoughts?

Real hungry, rough times right now, a gift card to dominos or something would be nice
SPOILERS!!

In the movie, Joker, there are multiple clocks throughout the movie reflecting the time 11:11, but there are other instances in which we are told, for example, in the very opening scene (or at the Murray Franklin Show -10:35-40
pm) that the time is 10:30 am (the 18th day of the garbage strike), as Arthur is readying himself first work. 

In the following scene, he is beaten in an alleyway (remember this for later...), presumedly at 11:11 am. This is a guess, but it seems more likely than not. This attack in the alley is one of a few dominoes that lead toward the Joker and toward the creation of Batman himself. 

As his job is a clown for hire, my guess is Arthur’s daily routine is not routine at all. So, the following day, when visiting with his social worker, who is literally the least helpful woman ever it seems, but we all have our problems, though her job is to ensure that he is holding up okay. The clock in the background shows 11:11 am (given it’s daylight). 

So, why is this significant? It’s because this number doesn’t mean it never happened, but rather, yet another domino falling as his own social worker fails to seem to care much about him at all. This is obvious. 


She asks him about being locked up and if he remembers why to which we are subjected to a flashback of Arthur hitting his head against the glass of a door within a white tiled room marked “Observation”. In this instance, the clock again reads 11:11 (not certain as to the time of day given he is locked away from natural light. 

Arthur has a habit of having either his head bashed by a sign, or bashing it into the glass of the door while locked up, and later on, when he gets fired by Hoyt, he bashes his head against the glass of the telephone booth he is in, shattering it actually. He also walks into the exit only door of the hospital hitting his head, and receives a rather devastating punch from Thomas Wayne. 

Finally, at Arkham, in order to be able to even look at the records for his mother, he bashes his head against the cage in which the file clerk works within. This is the last time he bashes his OWN head (next is Randall’s...) against anything as his mother’s file shows that head trauma has been the cause of his multiple psychological problems, a result of abuse. It appears that this head bashing was almost sub-conscious way of leading him to learn the truth of why he really is the way he is. 

So, the first head bashing via the sign probably at 11:11 am. The one from being locked up before also at 11:11, and now sitting here discussing why he was locked away at all, he says, “Who knows?” Because I don’t think he actually does know. 

But it seems clear that through head trauma (continued) or increased dancing over the course of the film, a darker part of Arthur is showing itself. An alter ego maybe? Perhaps that of the human shadow, a Jungian archetype, similar to Jekyll and Hyde or the wolf man maybe? But note that when this number or assumed time of 11:11 shows up, it is hinting at something alluded to in the first scene and in the last. 

There is a notable Batman reference In Arthur’s unfinished clown makeup that mimics the cowl/points of the Dark Knight’s future mask. But as of the time, Arthur creates this look, not yet perhaps aware of what it would go on to mean.

In this scene, Arthur is glancing in a mirror, and that brings me to the point of the mirror images/parallels that are constantly associated as they have been for so long in reference to Batman and the Joker...Two sides of the same coin. One thrives on chaos, and the other in order. But they oddly need each other to become better at being the hero/villain. 

As Arthur finally commits murder and is fired before that even, he comes in a day or so later to clean out his locker and he literally punches out the punch-in/punch-out time clock which naturally reads 11:11 am. This marks that Arthur no longer has a routine schedule, no social worker, no medications, no job...his day is increasingly spontaneous and unpredictable now. However, he seems to be okay with it. 

Bruce and Arthur are very much two opposite sides to such a metaphorical coin, a mirrored image if you will. I am not the first to note this either. 

Now, when everything goes down at the Murray Franklin Show it occurs about 10:40 pm. Arthur is handcuffed, and eventually the police vehicle hit by an ambulance, at likely close to 11:11 pm. 

Arthur the only survivor. He is pulled from the wreckage, yet, he remains unconscious. This means this is not from his perspective arguably, and the death of the Waynes is definitely not from his own perspective, and he influenced this event. 

The blood splatter across Bruce’s face is similar to that of Arthur’s face after shooting Murray. Also, the second scene of the movie has Arthur beaten down in an alleyway, and here in one of the final scenes you have the Waynes taken down in an alleyway as well. Another parallel if you ask me. 

Now, the death of the Waynes seems to revive Arthur, and it would be my guess that this moment not only occurs as Wayne dies, but at 11:11 pm. It is at 11:11 pm that the Joker is born, and not just that, he has managed to be the creator of the Batman himself. 

So, in this final scene, talking with another therapist, unable to stop laughing at this joke in his head, he is asked what is so funny, to which he responds, “I was just thinking of a joke”. She asks if he would like to share this joke, and he shakes his head, claiming she wouldn’t get it, before a flash of the scene of Bruce Wayne standing over his parents bodies shows briefly. And, the clock yet again reads 11:11 am.

This to me marks that mirrored relationship and rivalry that will become infamous later on, and by utilizing the only time on a clock that is a mirror image of itself, then, that is just another way to consider it.

Hello! WordPress developer and optimization specialist here, with experience in both server side and site-side speed optimizations, as well as website accessibility. This is not just an "install one plugin and call it a day" operation.

I have an extensive background in site optimizations, ranging from a quick speed increase to full theme reworks and custom managed VPS hosting migrations for that extra boost! I also have personal and professional experience with website accessibility, from quick audits to full-site writeups.

## Why Should I Care About Speed?
* About half of site visitors expect pages to load in 2 seconds or less
* Google is considering giving slower websites a "badge of shame" [Source for Badge of Shame](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959865/google-chrome-slow-sites-badge-system-chrome-dev-summit-2019)
* Page speed and mobile friendliness play a non-trivial role in page rank. Slower speed means you appear further down in search engine rankings, leading to lower than optimal traffic from searches.
* Once your page load time hits 4s, on average 25% of your visitors will have given up and left
* At 8 seconds, that jumps up to over 40% page abandonment!

This translates to, on average, a 7% reduction in **conversions** per second the load is delayed. That's **conversions**, or actual sales, not just visitors! Having a slow site, especially one that's selling something, is costing you money. [Source for Speed Metrics] (https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/?wide=1)

### How Can You Help Me?

With my experience and tools available, I am able to build an optimization plan to fit any budget. No money to move to a dedicated hosting environment? No worries, there's still plenty I can do to help! Want your site the fastest it can possibly be? I'm more than happy to build out a plan for you as well!

* **Optimizations start as low as $50**, depending on steps taken
* Free Estimate, No Obligations: Just PM me your website URL and who you are hosting with
* If you have a budget in mind, just let me know! Otherwise I'll put together a few options, for a low, mid, to higher budget.

## Accessibility: What's The Big Deal?

You've probably heard the word "accessibility" with regards to the internet in the news lately. If you haven't, accessibility has to do with the ability of ALL users to use and access your website. This includes users who are deaf, who are have low or no vision, who have color-blindness, dyslexia, limited physical mobility, as well as temporary disabilities such as migraines.

### That sounds great and all, but what does this have to do with *my* site?

To start with, an accessible site means that you open yourself to a wider audience. More readers, more paying customers, and more quality traffic. In addition, those that do visit your site have a positive experience that reflects on their perception of your business or brand.

* **Acessibility is REQUIRED by Law**. Title III of the ADA requires that:

&gt; every owner, lessor, or operator of a “place of public accommodation” provide equal access to users who meet ADA standards for disability.

* In a [recent court case](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-dominos-pizza/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-dominos-bid-to-avoid-disabilities-suit-idUSKBN1WM1P1), Dominoes' arguement that the ADA did not apply to websites was rejected by the Supreme Court.

* While ADA initiated lawsuits do not provide payment to the plantif, the business is required to pay lawyers fees (often topping $10,000 to $20,000+) if ruled against.

### What can you do for me?

* Automated accessibility audits are often pages and pages of technical details about aria attributes and heading structure. I offer audits that break things down into common language, with concrete fixes or suggestions. Full WCAG / Section 508 audits and fixes often start at $5,000 and run upward from there. This is meant as a starting point, for someone who wants to make his or her site more accessible without breaking the bank.

* Affordable Accessibility Audits: Options range from a quick "major functions check", which is one of the standards used for determining viability of a lawsuit (all major functions must be either accessible, or have a 100% equal alternative), to a more in-depth full-site analysis and write-up, including suggested action points to fix. These audits are not just "point a scanning tool" audits, but include actionable suggestions for fixing the issue. (Note: These audits cannot guarentee WCAG / 508 compliance. These are meant to generate a plan of attack to improve site accessibility).

* Also Available by Appointment: Website use testing by a user using screen-reading software (VoiceOver, JAWS)

* Once an audit is complete, you are presented with a list of suggested action points. I do not require that you have these done by me, although if you wish to, I'm certainly happy to work with you to clean up any issues found!

* Accessibility audits start at $70 for a "major functionalities" overlook, and more detailed options can be discussed from there.

## Timeframes, Payments, Etc
Turnaround time will depend on number of interested parties, extent of optimizations agreed upon or audits scheduled, and other factors (such as time to setup custom VPS servers). Estimates will be sent out within less than 24 hours of receiving a PM. 

Payments are accepted through PayPal or Stripe, although other methods can be discussed on an individual basis if desired. Larger projects (such as full site optimization and migration to personal VPS) usually require a partial deposit up front, which can be discussed in more detail.

Input:
[(2,3)(3,1)(1,5)]

Output:
True

Input: 
[(1,8)(7,2)]

Output:
False

The purpose is to return True if the second values match the values of the first values of the next sets.

def domino_cycle(tiles):
  l = len(tiles);
  flag = 0;
  for i in range (0,l):
    if (tiles[i][1] != tiles [(i+1)%1][0]):
      flag = 1;
      break;
  return (True if flag == 0 else False)

Found a source online that supposedly had the solution to the problem but I had some questions.

Why have a count (in this case flag) when we don't need to keep count on how many repeated values there are?

Why use a modulo when comparing?

Why is the answer wrong?

*If you think your teacher is tough, wait ’til you get a boss. He doesn’t have tenure.*

- *Guy who never had a boss, Bill Gates*

People are always asking me if I know Goldberg.

I met Goldberg in Redmond. Yes. THAT Redmond.

Goldberg was a professional Scab. Back in the old days, there were Scabs. It was a derogatory term for people who were hired to work in place of union workers when the unions striked. This happened a lot in Washington. It was hard at times to figure out if the evil companies were at fault or the, think Gangs of New York, Unionists were. Either way, Washington was once host to some pretty wicked disputes. This was a major component of news in the 80s. It all kinda went away in the 90s. But it’s worth mentioning.

Golberg was in on something big, and I was just bored enough to half ass whatever it was.

Goldberg explained that the operating systems we own now own us and that we are slaves to our computers.

“Shit man, you’re living in a borrowed generation! A generation of children that are trying to become adults in a no alternative world, mang! This whole town smells like teen spirt - you dig?”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

“Let’s go make soap!”

If you like long hours and getting laid off, Microsoft is for you. Founded by Bill Gates, Paul Allen, and Qbert, Microsoft was heir to the Seattle economy after Boeing started taking a shit and eventually left. Microsoft has been taking a nose dive for the last few years, but when you’re as high up in Fortune 500 as Captain Kirk on speedballs, it really doesn’t matter. Bill Gates is still the richest man in the world and Paul Allen just sold his summer home to Amazon so they could build space eggs or something. Microsoft will continue to ebb and flow with Apple. Just accept it. Ride it out. You’ll get your job back.

Goldberg had this place in Redmond. It was more Totem Lake than Juanita. When I walked in the door, Lake City was walking out. Like a cheap whore, Kirkland followed. I thought to myself: this guy must put his boner in women waaaaaayyyyyyyy more than I do. Turns out Goldberg also worked at Whole Foods.

There’s a Whole Foods in Redmond. Big surprise. Personally, the only reason to go to Whole Foods is the guac, salsa, and Homerun Inn pizzas. Homerun Inn is a pizza joint in Chicago and this is the closest you will get to Chicago pizza in Washington without paying the 40 dollar shipping Lou Malnati’s charges. That I’ve found. Someone sent me a link to a new place opening in Interbay. I’ll have to try it. One time I went to Whole Foods and for the first time in my life almost didn’t complete a purchase based on the price of the item. Typically, I know how much tortilla chips cost. Typically, they are about three to five dollars. Typically, I’m shocked when they are 15. Typically, I don’t buy chips at Whole Foods anymore.

Goldberg explained he had a club. He called it Night Club. The first rule of Night Club is you prefunk before you go to Night Club. The second rule of Night Club is you wear Axe body spray. The third rule of Night Club is you get Jimmy John’s if you see danger.

Everyone knows about the great sandwich wars of 2012. Subway had killed all the small delis in the area that were actually good. These were delis that you found in shopping plazas. Anyone remember Hoagie’s Corner? The dillie of a deli? They were independent and they were frigging good. These delis are no more. The closest you can get is some small convenience stores that still make sandwiches. Like Tiger Mountain Country Store. Panera came in around 2005ish. Around 2010 Jimmy John’s came in and the best story I have about that is a friend who was in Pullman and he bought Jimmy John’s for a group of guys that were visiting. He got lost on the way home in the middle of the night. As he explains. “I ate a sandwich on the way back. But then I got lost and scared. So I ate another sandwich.” Point is: if you ever feel scared and alone, eat a fear sandwich. Pot Belly’s came about four years ago. I think Pot Belly’s is the best of the big chains, but like Panera I’m getting sick of it. Corner Bakery just opened in Issaquah, but I haven’t tried it. The sandwich war did have one casuality: Quiznos. It was a hard war on everyone. But there’s a Jimmy John’s in Redmond. Goldberg still talks about the war like it was yesterday.

Near Novelty Hill we ran into a man who worked at Jimmy John’s. Goldberg pulled a gun on him and asked for his ID. He gave us the ID and then Goldberg asked him what he wanted to do when he grew up. He said he wanted to work at Microsoft. Goldberg asked why he was working at Jimmy John’s and not Microsoft. The man explained that he got laid off. So Goldberg shot him. Goldberg is mysterious. We Uber’d to Marymoor to pick up MILFs.

I’ve never been to Marymoor park and for good reason. The place is teaming with drunks. And not just regular drunks - old drunks. That’s two strikes: being old and being drunk. If you’re old and drunk, you better sober up or get some Benjamin Buttons before you get behind the wheel of a car. The reason these old people are drunk is because of the concerts in the park. I think Hootie and the Blowfish are the youngest people to ever take stage there and they did it a couple years ago when Hootie was 78. The elderly from all over Washington come to hold a lighter up as Huey Lewis sings about his new drug, which is actually a blood thinner.

Goldberg had a plan to slowly dismantle Microsoft, The Bellevue, hell, the entire system! But first he needed some candles at Pier One.

Redmond Town Center is your go-to if you want to go shopping in a mall and want to avoid Bellevue traffic. It’s an outdoor mall - which means it’s fun! There are restaurants, shops, and lost elderly people like most malls. I don’t know if it’s still there, but one of the ten comic book stores in the area is near the parking garage. There’s a music store. A Macy’s. It’s a good place to replace an eating disorder with a shopping problem.

After buying candles, I lost time. I woke up driving on the 202 and there was no sign of Goldberg.

The 202 is interesting because it links a number of cities that should have nothing to do with each other: Woodinville, Redmond, Sammamish, Issaquah, Fall City, Carnation, Duvall. Imagine people from Fall City with access to Sammamish? That’s where you get people selling meat out in parking lots. That’s also where you probably get all the smokers and hillbillies and feed stores in Redmond. Honestly, for a rich people city, I’ve never seen so many smokers. Or hillbillies. If I’m driving in Redmond, there’s a 90% chance I’m going to see a Datsun full of old fryers, rakes, and generators huffing down the street with a Haggard sticker on the back.

I retraced my steps. I drove back to Pier One and the sales lady somehow knew my name, my phone number, and my email address. I grabbed her and yelled “How do you know this!!!” She said “Mr. Goldberg, you signed up for our rewards card.”

I was Goldberg.

So, I went to Redmond Bar and Grill and got wasted.

Redmond Bar and Grill is pretty cool. There’s plenty of beers and games. The food is good. I think my buddy’s friend owns it.

I stumbled to the Matador and found that it was just littered with Girl’s Night Outs. You’d think that would be a good thing, but women get militant about Girl’s Night Outs and unless you’re Brad Pitt, they won’t accommodate your carousing. Matador is also a good hang out if it’s date night with the crew. When you are with your friends and somehow got screwed into taking all of your girflriends with, Matador is your go-to.

There’s also Coho. I recommend the bacon wrapped jalepenos stuffed with goat cheese. They probably don’t have them anymore. I have a gift certificate I still have 17 bucks on that I might use tonight as the storm levels Seattle. Be aware: The Space Needle is coming down tonight. This storm will probably put 14% of you in the morgue. This storm is not joking. This storm is not knocking. This storm will give you rabies.

Mac and Jack’s is in Redmond. It was pretty much the most popular craft beer back in the early 2000s. Microsoft used to serve it at their company parties, which by the way would close streets and included free booze and all sorts of rides and stuff. Until the company started pooping. Now they don’t have it. So, if you work at Microsoft, know this: you got screwed out of free Mac and Jack. Levitate once told me they only served local beer when I tried to order a Mac and Jacks. That was odd.

As I stumbled through Redmond, people kept coming up to me and saying “Hello, Mr. Goldberg.” and so forth. Finally, I went into Zeek’s and the waiter there told me that Operation The Bellevue is ready and on track. After asking him repeatedly what that operation was, he told me it was the name of the pizza I usually ordered there.

Zeek’s is overpriced. There, I said it. It’s good. But it’s not that good. They have a bunch of weird Zaw-like toppings and catchy names for their pizzas. But it’s like 25 bucks for a pizza the size of a Totinos.

I checked my wallet and found that there were a number of coupons to area businesses that I had never seen. Also, tickets to soccer games. I hate soccer. And don’t call your team a Football Club if they’re in America. They are a fucking soccer team!!!! My anger inspired me to go to Canyons to sort out my identity crisis and my hatred of soccer.

Canyons is a restaurant I vaguely remember. A friend lived up the street and we’d walk down there or to Coho. I think they had a firepit. At the time it was like a fancy place. Or, when I was 22 and could only afford a salad without lettuce, it was. One thing I can promise you: they didn’t take EBT. One time I was so drunk I tried to bribe them to take EBT with real money. In Redmond, there’s so much logic being used by Microsoft that there’s not always enough to go around.

After losing the script to Fight Club, I decided to order Paul Allen 39 pizzas from Frankie’s out of spite.

Frankie’s pizza is a smaller, newer chain as far as I know. But it’s just not that good. It was always on Groupon and the coupon flyers you get in the mail. But it’s just not that good. It’s not like bad like Dominos or Papa John’s. But it’s not that good.

There’s a Qdoba in Redmond. I was in the Issaquah one on 911 at lunch. They had the news on the TV in the corner. I don’t know how I had an appetite that day. But that’s my biggest memory from Qdoba. Also, they have OK food. It’s like if you’re bored of Taco Time and know that Chipotle is horseshit...I just wanted to shit on Chipotle. That place blows.

If you’re entering Redmond from Issaquah...seriously, you pictured yourself having sex with Redmond or Issaquah there, huh? So, right when you get into Redmond you look up and there’s this huge freeway out of nowhere. It’s like a cluster of overpasses that makes you think you are in the future. But you aren’t. You are in Redmond at the base of 520:

The singularity.

Anyway. Turns out I wasn’t Goldberg. I was just really, really, really high...if you count Issaquah.
I hope that these format correctly for your enjoyment. If not here is a link to the actual spreadsheet that I keep on my blueprints. Thanks for trying these out.

Today I relapsed, 44 day streak. I am proud of myself

I didn't need P to MO but NoFap helped my change permanentely. I don't feel guilty for jerking off, I don't feel like I have any brain fog and I didn't wallow in despair at what I did. I cleaned up then proceeded to clean my apartment as planned. Before you go and jerk off with an excuse, my life change dramatically on NoFap. I went from sleeping at 4am everyday to waking up at 7am bright and early. I read and finished a book for the first time in ten years. I went on a fucking date.   


That won't stop because I relapsed today. I care more that I killed my 44 day streak than the fact that I MO'd, which leads me to believe NoFap was not the solution for me. I had something going for me in life for once and I rode that wave like no other, one little domino fell into multiple paths of rehabilation from the past depressing years of my life. There are other things I think I have to do to keep going, but consider my story as a way for you to find another path if you keep failing this one. Not everyone is the same and there are different solutions for all of us. Goodbye NoFap! Thanks for the start

I'm looking for inspiration about mechanics around concept of "rebellion" from a central government point of view. Some material I've collected:

&amp;#x200B;

**Rebel inc.**

&amp;#x200B;

Player is a peacekeeper, trying to stabilize part of a country, building wells, gather consensum and fight back insurgent group. From game design point of view I really like:

&amp;#x200B;

\- active pause for player: easy to understand, easy to use

\- stability: sum for stability in every part of the map. From 0 to 100. Local player actions increase it over time ( and events too )

\- one main resource: money, used to do and unlock actions in different tree. Gathered every turn (end of the month)

\- fog of war (sort of): player cannot interact with every part of the map at start, but can see it. To toggle this "fog of war" player must wait until "gathering intel" about a part of the map is completed, requiring several turns. Interesting point here is this action start from player base and is incremental from every "unlocked" territory. Interesting and very themed-based

\- support (derived resource, player cannot buy it with money, but doing actions and over time): player must "win" support from population building infrastructures (wells, roads) and addressing local problems. This require some planning, balancing local needs (do I really need to build a road here? they want also support for create new jobs) to global need (I really need to increase my global support before i lose!). 

\- reputation (derived resource, controlled indirectly by player action): starting from 100 to 0, some events (scripted) can modify if it . Interesting that "enemies" when control provinces lower it over time, with a "snowball" or "domino effect". I think this is key point for rebellion games, let player "feel" urgency to close small problems before they can become bigger and bigger!

\- enemies: unlocked after some turns of play (1 turn =&gt; 1 month) start from most distants provinces from player base. Enemy armies try to "conquer" a province after a battle, so player must move armies to fight back (later about combat). One really interesting point is "domino effect". Every connected enemy-controlled province increase exponentially reputation damage for player, forcing him to fight back or lose. One another good point are "external enemies" bring money to insurgent group and let them raise more and more dangeours armies.

\- armies and combat: player can defeat enemies moving one troop in one territory and giving support from neighbour territories. This force player to think and plan moves, because enemies try always to escape if a battle is not winnable. Only way to defeat an enemy army is to corner with troops and rivers ( because enemy are not able to swim, lol ! ). Player's soldiers can be upgrated using money ( no exp system here ) and fort can be unlocked, but player cannot place them where he want. This an understatable choice, because forts give support to player troops, so players could exploit this and place forts everywhere, but on the other side is really, really annoying to see game propose to place a fort where is not strategic (some hidden logic, out of player control)

\- corruption/inflation: related to do many actions in same turn, using money too much, spread corruption and inflation. Corruption lower support by population and inflation makes every buy more expensive.

\- peace conference: if player has enough global stability can open a peace conference and negotiate with rebels. This require a lot of time ( influence on enemy forces, conquered provinces, etc.. ) and can lead to victory or lose ( because player has to please also external actors too!)

&amp;#x200B;

I really like how game elements are mixed together ( with more feature, of course, I want to stress on more important for me!), resulting a mix of planning, decision for player and a "feel" of urgency and "domino effect" in mid/late game.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Europa Universalis IV**

&amp;#x200B;

Player decide fate of a nation from middle age to modern age. It's a massive game with many gameplay elements, I want to focus on rebellions:

&amp;#x200B;

\- after a war, conquered territories are no immediately integrate in player empire and has an "unrest value"

\- each turn (one month), this unrest value is modified against empire unrest global value so can go up or down. Player can do various things using his resources ( money, military points, hiring advisors, raise autonomy of a province ) to control this value. Anyway there is a percentage when a rebellion start, with a prediction of time ( 1 year, 10 year ) and power ( 1 army, 20 armies and so on) and type of rebels (separatist, peasant revolt, noble revolt, etc.. ) with differen goals ( leave player empire, lower taxes, more influence in player empire, etc.. ).

\- when a rebellion start, rebel army try to conquer province where they are and fight back any player army ( or another AI controlled armies ). They move around map conquering provinces until they are able to get enough power (influence over government ?) and force player to accept they demands 

\- because in EU IV many game systems are interconnected, even religion, cultural, enemies ( they can support with money a revolt.. and player can do the same!) can influence where a rebellion start.

&amp;#x200B;

I like how this "subgame" is integrated inside EU 4, even if is simplistic. Player can fight rebels ( win or lose ), postpone when rebels will spawn ( using resources ), accept they demands and no so much. I think is a missed opportunity to not interact more diplomatically with rebels, because sometimes rebels goals are conflicting and game designer should let player exploit this.

After some rebellion is a very repetitive sub-game and as player you are most of the time bored by rebels.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu**

&amp;#x200B;

(it's a board game)

Players ( cooperative &lt; 4 players) trying to stop old gods awakening. It's not a rebellion, but I really enjoy playing it because has this "domino effect":

&amp;#x200B;

\- every player has 4 action point, so this is player main resource

\- every player has 5 sanity point, encounter with a monster or events can redouce this amount. If all players become crazy, game is lost. Interesting being crazy is not game over for player, but reduced base ability

\- every player has some clue cards to use for closing portals, trading between players is essential and this encourage cooperation and coordination

\- player can one of them to move from one location to another of the map, one to kill a cultist, three to kill a shoggoth, one to close a portal

\- events can change ( in worst ) player actions, requiring more actions points, more enemies on board etc..

\- four or more cultist in a location invoke a new old-one, so worst condition for players

\- every turn new enemies appears on the map, so kill them is essential

&amp;#x200B;

What I really like is cooperation between players, coordinations on movements (alone you cannot do everything) and "domino effect". Let alone 2 or more cultists is dangerous, but can manage probabilities ( will new cultists spwan in that area ? what I can do to stop them ?) and so on. 

It's a board game about old gods, cultists but if you translate in a government vs rebel scenario, could work too.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any other examples of these mechanics and how they are applied to games ? Thanks!

I select the 5.99 thing, get a pop up asking if I want veggie/meat/supreme for $2 extra, I say yup (extravaganza), then it errors.  Tried both phone(android) and pc website, both having similar problems.  Note I have done this before - more than once - and it worked.

edit:

If I click thru the errors it tries to charge me 16.99 instead of 7.99...  haven't ordered yet but wondering what's up.  tried selecting my previous order too from history, same thing happening.   So, I think they ended this promotion, but didn't implement it right on the app/website cuz it still offers it even tho its not available.... I think.

Or maybe it's just a glitch and if I keep retrying I'll figure out how to get the order thru with the popup deal.... if not maybe I'll order somewhere else instead; Domino's has been the go-to-pizza delivery for me for a while cuz of this deal (and I like the taste too) but maybe it's time to explore other options....

Investing in real estate is like a game of chess instead of checkers. A single error can cause a nasty domino effect, but that should not be a deterrent. You are going to find success if you know what to do, and this article is going to help you figure some things out before you begin.

&amp;#x200B;

Never invest your money into property that you have not personally seen and inspected. Some sellers will offer to cover the inspection, but they might be using some who favors them. Always get a neutral report or a lookover from someone that you personally trust.

&amp;#x200B;

Always be on time when you set up a meeting with a potential client. This will indicate that you mean business and will show no disrespect to your potential customer. Coming to a meeting late shows that you are unorganized and do not care about your customers, which will cause you to lose them.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to get into real estate investing, but do not have enough money to buy a piece of property on your own, do not fret. Look at real estate investment trusts. Operating much like mutual funds, you can invest what funds you have available into a larger group pool and still make some money off of real estate mortgages.

&amp;#x200B;

When you're trying to come up with a strategy for a business, know that the costs that are sunk go further than a home's general price. From inspection to closing costs, there are many influences on your bottom line. Think of margin costs and put them in the line item list.

&amp;#x200B;

Investing in real estate isn't as complex when you know what strategies to use for making wise investment decisions. If you are unsure of what to do, it becomes very hard to succeed in this world. So, use what you have learned, and realize that you should continue to pick up new information and have a strong plan prior to beginning your real estate portfolio.

"M-m... M"  No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.  "M-m-mine..."  However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.  "M-m-m-minecraft..."  Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.  "Minecraft..."  A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.  "MINECRAFT..."  But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.  "Minecraft good Fortnite bad"  And then the silence broke"OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::"  Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.  I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.  "M-m-mi... Mine..."  Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.  "MINE..."  Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.  "MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack"  A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie \&amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, OprahWinfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.  "MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT"  No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.  Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...  I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.  0.  "Minecraft good Fortnite bad Instagram normie Emojis bad Keanu breathtaking Wholesome 100 \[Everyone liked that\] Area 51 PETA bad 69 nice 420"  "AaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyaYayaYaASyAAaYaaYayaAAAaaUGgGHHhHHhhHHhhHHh📷📷📷📷📷🥵🥵mmmmMMMMmMmMMMMMMMMM📷🤯📷📷📷📷🤪📷hhhhhhHhFFFfffF"  Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.  The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.  Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.  This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.
This could probably go under the /AmITheAsshole sub as well but I don't really have a exact story to tell. 

anyways, I started college last year and was worried about meeting people so I was really extroverted and involved with things for the first two semesters, including doing summer school before tradition freshmen moved in with 100 or so other incoming freshman. Met a group of people there near the end that I got wrapped up with, one ended up becoming my roommate at the end of summer and I live with essentially three of them now. But I knew from the start that they weren't really who I wanted as my core group of friends. They just have different past times and humors than I, but the rest of them really click well together. I mentioned that I tried to be extroverted and I can be quite successfully but I really doubt relationships until I spend a decent amount of time in smaller groups or one on one due to being exhausted by social situations. So, I may know and see different people who I'll have small talk with daily on campus but I wouldn't think of as direct friends. I know for sure I do not want to relive with these people again next year because it's just too, overwhelming seeing them everyday and having to feel like an outsider. I'd rather being invited over to their place and feel wanted than sit in my room and hear them chatting away in the living room and not be invited to stay when I creep out for dinner. 

Recently, I ended what I call a two way toxic relationship with someone who I stayed close with in high school just after a domino effect on how they handled something, and while I wasn't expecting to loose that friendship, it's been nice to regain some mental space now that I'm not handling all of their problems for them anymore. So I've slowly been gauging what close friendships I have left and I'm kinda disappointed with how little people I feel like I can trust or feel comfortable around. That's my own fault and it will change with time, but as I continue to clear my social contact book of people I don't ever see anymore or don't have the same recreational activities with I can't help but wonder if I'm not surrounded with bad or inept friends, but that I'm the bad friend and I'm asking too much from companionship or wanting similar doctrine or whatever I qualify as worthy of outputting what limited amount of energy I have this semester into keeping that ball rolling. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: am I asking too much from my friendships? Should I just accept that these people who I am forced to be around should become my core group of friends despite me not wanting them to be?

Hi r/ResinCasting ! I’m a total newbie to this field, and long story short, I want to make a resin keychain (about as wide as a domino and as deep as two stacked). Based on all the basics I’ve seen I feel comfortable doing the casting and whatnot, but being a first timer I’m not familiar with how durable it is. If I would drill the hole in the keychain, would it splinter? Is there a better alternative like setting a toothpick in and drilling through that? Something else all together? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!
Just curious, trying to find more options for that asshole. I can breeze thru til that CB but haven't been able to beat him yet. I usually use duped 4/55 Cap IW, 4/55 Domino, 3/45 Masacre, 3/45 Rulk and duped 4/55 GR. I recently brought duped Colossus to 3/45, I'll take him to 4/55 soon. 

What would be best team for taking out the CB? I love the Domino trio bc of the damage output, is the trio plus Colossus and GR my best bet or should I take out the trio and use a Colossus synergy team?

I generally support this spending and believe it’s good for Tulsa and recognize that major public investment projects never please everyone. I’d rather spend and accept that bureaucracy is messy than do nothing. 

However, one line item continues to bother me. Why does the police department need another cost-intensive helicopter? What are the lifetime costs after the initial $4.5 million price tag? Life flight, fire, search and rescue all having helos makes sense to me.

But a gleaming new police helicopter in the 21st century has the strong odor of toys for boys. What function could a police helo perform that a third-party drone operator could not for a tiny fraction of the cost? Amazon is very close to doorstep drone delivery. So is Domino’s Pizza. Additionally, privacy controls can be programmed into drones but not human analysts. 

It would be safer for police. It would make more officers available on the ground. They’d be looking at a surveillance display viewable from the air or the ground. FLIR replaced the old spotlights TPD once used to track suspects.

Surely TPD will argue this spending replaces an aging aircraft. But that begs the question: Why are we replacing it in the first place? Why not just sell it?

Someone buy me a dominos pizza e gift card  [https://dominosstore.wgiftcard.com/responsive/personalize\_responsive/chooseDesign/dominos\_responsive/1](https://dominosstore.wgiftcard.com/responsive/personalize_responsive/chooseDesign/dominos_responsive/1)

I live on the cusp of downtown in NW. For the life of me, I cannot find a place that takes online orders where I can do a half &amp; half pizza for delivery. Hot Lips doesn't offer it. Sizzle Pie pretends to offer it, but it doesn't work on its website. (Also, I'd want half one type, half another - I don't want to have to pick a bunch of ingredients individually for each half.) No places seem to offer options for two different halves on Uber Eats, Caviar, Grub Hub, etc.

All I want is a half &amp; half pizza, and I want to order it online without having to call anyone or pay a delivery person when they arrive. Why is this so hard? Any places do this??

edit: **LOCAL PIZZA PLACES** - not national chains like Dominos or Papa Johns or Pizza Hut!
