So the pilot has to dance around it in a truly tame and tedious fashion, never giving the slightest hint that any of its promiscuous demons from Hell even has genitalia.

# On Stage: Prologue

The piano music playing in the beginning is Claire de Lune by Claude Debussy

# Dope

When the boys are dancing together during the second chorus, there are banners with German writing on the wall behind them. The red one says " Keine Profite mit der Miete," meaning "no profit with rent," and the white one says  “Friede den Hütten! Krieg den Palästen!” meaning "peace in the huts, war in the palaces. [Here is a link to a German Army's explanation of these phrases.](https://aminoapps.com/c/btsarmy/page/blog/dope-mv-the-story-behind-the-german-slogans/o3RZ_73wSdu7XBw2anVZ45k0j0jLgvj3gkB)

# Fire

\-The scene where Suga shakes hands with a hooded man is a reference to the album cover of Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd. [https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m0ofUWYXL.\_SY355\_.jpg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m0ofUWYXL._SY355_.jpg)

\-The scene where Jungkook sits on a trash can and watches a burning bike roll past is a reference to the movie Lost River. You can also see the words Lost River spray painted on the door on the left.

\-This might be a stretch but I think the scene where they iron Jin is a reference to the lyrics of Save Me, "Thank you... for ironing me who was wrinkled."

# Spring Day

\-The train is a reference to the movie *Snowpiercer*. RM's rap in the beginning also mentions the Snowpiercer.

\-The motel that is shown is called Omelas. This is a reference to the short story *The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas* by Ursula le Guin. 

# Serendipity

It's not confirmed, but some people think this music video is based on "The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. 

# Blood Sweat and Tears

\-The entire music video is based off of the book *Demian* by Herman Hesse. It contains a lot of imagery and themes from the book, and the quote that RM reads during the cut scene is also from *Demian*.

\-The music that plays at the beginning is "Kyrie," from Mass in B Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach.

\-The statue with no arms is Venus de Milo, and the black statue is Perseus with the Head of Medusa by Benvenuto Cellini. 

\-The painting that Jin stares at is *Fall of the Rebel Angels* by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.

\-When V is sitting on a balcony and appears to jump into a painting, the painting is *Landscape with the Fall of Icarus*, also by Bruegel the Elder. It's very hard to notice, but this painting is also in the blue/purple room with the fallen chandeliers where the whole group is in the beginning. It's hanging on the right wall. (You can see it a bit more clearly when Jungkook is floating in the same room at 3:44).

\-Both Breugel paintings are in the BS&amp;T Japanese's music video too.

\-On the side of the floor when transitioning from RM's room to Jimin and Suga's room (pause the video at 3:13), there is a label that says Chatroom 2,3 ↑. This is a reference to the movie *Chatroom,* but I'm not sure about the 2,3 then up arrow. The room that Suga and Jimin are in, with the glass squares on the floor and a door behind them, is also similar to a scene from *Chatroom.* [*https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NzVt82RU5elq\_WnDpw0xlDuCdo3GVz85w0\_vCTAVlTW5lECA2Ny44YOWY6UJ2Ui4mC\_av8kRxjdORWMNGbErS4PZUX0FwfrKMw=w1600-rw*](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NzVt82RU5elq_WnDpw0xlDuCdo3GVz85w0_vCTAVlTW5lECA2Ny44YOWY6UJ2Ui4mC_av8kRxjdORWMNGbErS4PZUX0FwfrKMw=w1600-rw)

\-The statue in the background of J-Hope's solo scenes is the Pieta by Michelangelo. 

\-The song that Suga plays on the organ is *Passacaglia in D Minor* by Dietrich Buxtehude. In Demian, there is a character that plays the organ and is specifically mentioned playing Buxtehude.

\-As Jin goes to kiss the statue, on the wall there is mirror and above it the words “Man muss noch Chaos in sich haben, um einen tanzenden Stern gebären zu können. (You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star.)” This is a quote by Friedrich Nietzsche, who is also mentioned in Demian.

\-The statue that Jin kisses is Abraxos from Demian.

# Unknown Artworks from BS&amp;T

 If anybody could help me with these I'd be very grateful. 

\-All the statues/photos of statues, save Venus and Perseus, in the very beginning "museum" scene. 

\-In the next scene, where they sit on the coach, there is a painting on the ceiling (more easily seen at 3:43), a painting behind them (also at 3:43), a painting propped up on the floor next to Jin (more easily seen at 2:17), and a painting of a horse that's slightly visible behind the left curtain. The painting on the ceiling is also in the Japanese music video when J-hope and Jimin are dancing (It's not a Bruegel tho, I checked).

\-In Namjoon's room with the antlers, there are some books on the mantle. Also there's a desk with a painting of what I think is a Madonna and Child, but there are so many Madonna and Childs in the world that I can't tell which. There's more paintings on the walls and two photos statues on the floor as well.

Maybe I'm being weird and just hyper-fixating on things and this is in no way meant to dismiss all the positivity I have seen, but I feel like Kel could literally perform a miracle onstage AND do a perfect-score worthy dance and 65% of the comments would still be dismissing him as a non-contender/ somehow on par with some of the weaker dancers and at this point in the competition, I'm confused? Is this because he featured in the Bottom Two or ???


So I think that my crush likes me back. We have known each other since 7th grade but never really talked untill last year, we became pretty good friends quickly and she randomly just started sitting with my friend group (always across from or next to me), and a few weeks ago I was told by a friend of both of us that she only sat with us to talk to me. She does have other friends (some that are guys) but she still really only sits with me, and she has friends that shes known for years (I see her sometimes hanging out with them in the hallways and around town) which just baffles me. We usually just talk about games, memes, and other bits of our lives. We sometimes tease each other and what not and always smile at each other. Recently, I had asked her if she wanted to see a movie with me and she said yes and we had a great time (everyone but my wallet, tickets were 13 bucks each) and afterwards she asked if I was hungry and then bought me some ice cream. Then last weekend she had asked if I wanted to go get lunch with her and she asked if we could meet further from the restaurant so we could walk together, afterwards she had followed me back to the place, passing her street to keep talking with me. However, on Tuesday a friend had asked her if she had a crush on anyone and she had said no, I wasnt there (I was sick for a while) but the friend had told me about it and then I lookd back and couldnt tell if she had just wanted to be friends or if she did have a crush on me. I'm probably just overthinking but I would like some more input

Also, about a month ago we had done volunteer work together the same day of a school dance and I had asked if she wanted to go the dance and she had said yes, but then a friend had shown up at the place we were volunteering. We all went to the dance and then got ice cream. Just thought this might beimportant.
After the urge of several people from this subreddit to play the DLC of DS1, I gave in and dove into the past. Boy am I glad I did. The DLC is just a collection of enjoyable boss battles.

I know a lot of people love Artorias (I do too), but in my opinion Magnus was the highlight of the DLC. Super aggressive, super strong , super unfair, his relentless attacks give no room for breathing nor healing.

I took about 4 hours to beat the guy, but a big chunk of that time was wasted with me just diving into the abyss and doing my best to manhandle magnus.

Eventually I grew tired of losing so I checked up some tips online--and the best tip I found was to understand his forearm movements. And then I spent the next hour and a half deconstructing his moveset.

It was at that point that I was sure of what I felt--I was thoroughly enjoying the game. Just one more... That was what I was continuously telling myself. One more and I'll perfect it... And perfect it I did. The last round between me and magnus was a dance--I was totally in the zone and I knew I had it in the bag.

All in all I enjoyed the process of learning. This is why I love dark souls so much. It doesn't try to be too realistic - - it knows it is a game, and it puts you in the position of learning how to beat the game methodically.

I love this game so much.


This may not be the right sub for this but it's the best I could find

I don't remember much about the show expect for a single part of it which includes what I remember to be a 3d animated purple cat dancing on stage with lights flashing behind 

I can't remember what the entire show was about but I remember that it would cut to the cat near the end of the show 

I last saw the show in 2004-2005

And I've been trying to remember it since 2015.

So any help is appreciated
 

**Introduction:**

Elric is an Elven Bladesinger Wizard, he spent a century studying both magic and sword technique at the Eilpine Grandarius (Elven magic college). During his time there he fought with another student as a result he lost his arms due to the damage, with the help of some others he researched and build prosthetic arms (started as a joke about FMAB). this occurs in a mid magic setting.

**Physical appearance / Gear:**

Elric is a 178 year old Male High Elf, he stands at 183cm (6'0) with a Rhomboid build (shoulders slightly wider than hips). He has Icy blue eyes, fairly pale skin, and a short parted hairstyle. his face is littered with small faded scars with 3 prominent ones: the first going from the middle of the forehead to the right of the jaw going over the eye, further to the right only going across his eyebrow to the middle of his cheek, finally from the middle of his left cheek across to the middle of his chin. he is missing his arms but has prosthetics. 

He wears a dark brown Sheepskin Trench Coat with matching colour trousers, a dark blue tunic underneath. he carries a Sultan's scimitar in his right hand and has blue flames which emit a cold mist in his left. laying around the back of his neck lays a black and white cat as his familiar, with blue eyes like his.

**Personality:**

Growing up high in the mountains Elric is used to the cold and his skin and attitude reflect this. He carries himself with confidence and grace, though he carries a somber air about him. He is willing to do anything if it means that he can do good or get closer to finding his captured lover, Arya, who was captured by Orcs. He thinks before he acts and prefers to have a plan and abandon it then to rush in without thought, regardless of the plan he won't stop until he accomplishes his goals. Due to his cloistered background he carries an untrustworthy demeanor in his speech.

**Background:**

*You see I'm a man who is slow to anger, but when you take something that I love from me; you're playing a dangerous game. I like to help others where I can, no matter the cost. but I'll go the some extreme lengths to protect the people who are important to me. now imagine how far I'll go to recover the one who saved my soul, and who I failed to protect. on to less grim sentiments, my particular affinity for cold magic lends me to helping my allies but impairing our enemies while I dance while my blade sings. However I do find myself lacking when it comes to arcane matters concerning fire, things tend to be... unpredictable.*

Hey all, recently I read some tweets talking about Kazakhs in Mongolia, what's happening there? About learning Mongolian in school?

How Kazakh-nationalist are Kazakhs in Mongolia in general may I ask?

Like in Xinjiang, China, Kazakhs are very nationalists, constantly bragging about Kazakhstan and Kazakh history, and usually have very wrong historic facts, like they always say stupid shits like:

"Chinggis Khan is Kazakh", "Chinggis Khan spoke Kazakh at home with his mother", "Back then people in Mongol Empire were all Kazakhs", "Northern Xinjiang and Western Mongolia belong to Kazakhstan from thousand years ago", "Kazakhs are Mongolian's grandfather", "All Mongolian dances originated from Kazakhs" and other shits.

But you know Kazakhs only formed their ethnic identity after Kazakh Khanate, which is few hundred years later than Mongol Empire. And the Turkic-tribes back then cannot be equate to modern Kazakhs, like Kyrgyzs, Tuva, Altai and Oirat people all have ancient Turkic blood. But you know the most of them never read actual historic papers or books, they only believe the fake stuff they read in some Kazakh forums (usually in Chinese social media).

Thus Mongolians in Xinjiang usually have bad relationships with Kazakhs, especially online, you see them always fighting over something. Also Uyghurs and Kazakhs do not get along sometimes as well, so do Kyrgyz and Kazakhs.

So how do people in Mongolia get along with Kazakhs? I heard many of them cannot speak Mongolian even, and some of them cannot speak Kazakh. According to Mongolian Immigration Agency's recent data, there are almost 800 Kazakhs gave up their Mongolian citizenship and migrated to Kazakhstan in past 3 years, well, good for them!


I've been a huge fan of Obsidian and the Fallout series since the first game came out in the 90s (I'm old), and I was hyped for The Outer Worlds.  The gameplay is pretty solid for an RPG, but the writing is just atrocious.  For the life of me I can't understand why everyone is raving so much about it -- the game's script feels like a high schooler wrote it after spending a weekend googling "corporations greedy evil."  There's *no* nuance (the corporations are evil, the workers are oppressed and helpless, the executives are unrepentantly corrupt).  The characters are one-dimensional.  The world-building is atrocious and unbelievable.  The "humor" is obvious and over-the-top to the point of wackiness.   Such a disappointing step backwards from Fallout NV.

I winced at Disco Elysium a little bit at first; the dialogue with the Ancient Reptilian Brain and Limbic System made me think the game was trying too hard to be "deep" or Lynchian or whatever.  I was so wrong.  The characters are well-rounded and nuanced.  For example, Kim doesn't *always* act like a straight-laced foil to your antics, and his occasional deviations from his "typecast" character feel earned.  Your relationship with him genuinely develops over the course of the game depending on what you do.  Neither the corporate representative nor the union leader are mustache-twirling villains, nor are they heroes; they both have plausible cases to make.  The Hardee Boys feel like real people.  The worldbuilding is rich and well thought-out.  The game is often very dark, but it's also very funny in a way that isn't "silly" (save for maybe one or two moments that get a *little* silly, but they're all the better because they're so rare.  The dance scene is one of the few times I've ever laughed out loud at a video game).

And the game truly [breaks new ground](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HeartyScholarlyCowbird-mobile.mp4) with the whole "skills are characters" mechanism.  That's genuinely what it feels like to have a mind -- just little notional snippets of feeling or language that race through your head, often conflicting with each other.  And it's a great way for your chosen skills to impact gameplay.  I've never seen anything like it, and it's brilliant.

The whole thing was just a wonderful example of what *actual* great writing in a game looks like.  I hope the team makes millions and makes many, many more games.

Hey all,

I'm currently a freshman in high school, and we had auditions for the high school musical today. I did it last year as well, did poorly in auditions, but was given an ensemble part anyway. Today, I did pretty good, not amazing as it's only my second year, but not terrible like most of my peers. We later did dry reads, and I got the short end of the stick. A friend who did poorly in singing did really well in a talking-only part, a part I wanted and was auditioning for. I, on the other hand, was given a dryer character to try for, with not much room to work with. I did okay, but everyone absolutely loved my friend. It really made me feel bad and angry as it was a part I really thought I could get.

My question is: What do I do now? We have dance auditions tomorrow, and neither me or my friend can dance. This character does a dance, so neither of us will do amazingly. I realistically see myself getting a different speaking part, which is all I want. I just don't like the idea of my friend, who's doing this for the first time, getting a very funny part, which I wanted. I really like to act, so its annoying. I just want to be good, but I doubt I have a chance.
I started talking to this guy about two years ago as he was in the friendship group I had just joined. We would often talk a lot outside of school and at the beginning I used to flirt with him a lot. Over time I stopped liking him romantically but still enjoyed spending time with him as a friend. However, these conversations became so repetitive that I genuinely didn’t  have much to say and so the conversations became more and more one sided and he was initiating all the conversations. I would often tell him I had to go to work, and he’d dm me around 10 minutes later-obviously not enough time to finish what I was doing- and I always managed to open these messages subconsciously on my way to look something up so he would see I had read it. I hate ignoring people so idle give him a short reply that couldn’t be carried on from but the conversation always started going again.

 Earlier this academic year he left our school as his grades weren’t good enough, so naturally we talked less because of that. His constant initiation of conversations started to annoy me and over the half term I talking to him when I told him I had to go eat lunch. About 15 minutes later I responded to something on a group chat he was also on and he messaged me,privately, saying “I thought u were eating lunch”. I told him lunch isn’t a super long meal to eat, but the fact that he connected those two messages on different chats kind of freaked me out and I literally started writing 3/4 word answers in the convos. We don’t talk anymore but I haven’t told him why although technically he’s the one who stopped communication as I hadn’t started the convos in 2 months or so. We used to be really quite close and I miss the friendship we had at the beginning as he was so sweet and even sat with me during prom whilst all our friends were dancing so I wouldn’t be alone.

So AITA for not talking to my friend anymore?

I've had everything working for a while now, but recently, the red light next to the cartridge slot has stopped flashing and every game, plugin, and other software I had installed on my SD card is no longer accessible, giving me a message stating "The file is corrupt" without any additional error messages or codes to refer to.

I've removed the card and rebooted the device to find that all of the apps are still present on the live area screen, but upon opening, stating the file is corrupt. After putting the SD card I had back in, I opened up Vitashell to find that the SD card is not being read or detected by the device.

I have firmware 3.65 running on a PCH-1100 with a Funturbo SD2Vita 5.0 adapter and a 128 GB micro SD card, alongside a 4 GB official sony memory card.

The official memory card was set up not to hold games, which is most likely the case seeing as I had well over 80 gb of games on the device before running into this issue.

This occurred after trying to do a fresh reinstall of Persona 5 Dancing in Starlight.

I've tried looking this issue up on this reddit, but I haven't had any luck finding any clear answers.
I've been wanting to make a doom foretold deck (but dont want to play Teferi) and I've been wanting to make an Outlaw's Merriment deck (but dont want to play fires). 

they kinda fill the same slot, I dunno. 4 mana power build arounds. 

Mainly I'm looking for deck ideas that include Doom Foretold and/or Outlaw's Merriment because I think these cards are interesting. I might make the Esper control deck running around anyway, it just seems dull. I have the deck picked out for an Orzhov Control deck built around Doom Foretold and Ethereal Absolution, but it does seem to be missing that power card at 3 that Teferi fills in the Esper version, and it doesnt have the win con that Dance of the Manse is.

what are some other control decks that are built around Doom Foretold and/or Outlaw's Merriment?
Just wanted to let this band know,   if your not busy then listen up!  I have been  for singing
for 8 years +.  I discovered your music through a depressing part of my life, I am the type who plays, dances  to or sings 24/7. Not only did your music save my life and keel me moving, I listen and know all the songs of all the albums,  and I listen to them cause your voice is the highlight of my day( not to sound weird).  From a fellow Cancer,  and to the rest of the band,  I love you guys!  My name is Rose and I want you guys to keep it up!
Spike, stop dancing around it and just say that the difference in the way Embiid's conditioning is treated versus Jokic's conditioning is RACISM.  If you're gonna have a take, have the take, coward.
* **Frustration** i got from few planned dates that eventualy were canceled. But another are to come!

* **Angriness** i get from hormones or other situations that i dont have influence at. 

* **Horniess** about women that are tightening up so much to me while dancing.

All this screams to me to use some pixel stimulus or now rather more interesting for me now is(woud be) to use some girl for sex, but i keep going strong and resist from that, i only get numbers and want to date and get to know a girl, even tho it happened that girl wanted to go with me for casual sex - i didnt go for that. Staying in this state motivates me and keeps me in this agression mode with watning to look for women, meet them and geting to know. And being flirty with them. Looking strongly and very long in the eyes with no effort.
I’d seen Irreversible and Enter The Void but didn’t really fancy Climax until they discussed it.

It’s... a Gaspar Noe film. One of his best for sure. I love Irreversible and didn’t like Enter The Void. Climax was closer to the former. Some really incredible filmmaking and performances. 

I think it became a bit less interesting late on when it went full nightmare and random side characters just started becoming inexplicably violent. But I’ve also never OD’d on LSD in a dance club before so who knows. The long take of Sofia Boutella falling apart as she walked slowly through the building was amazing. 

Anyone else check it out?
Hi all  
Looking for some dares for a r18 games night and thought id get some ideas from you guys  
Looking for a 1-5 scale so would be great if you could comment with an idea for each

1. is super innocent (eg sing a song, do a dance, etc)
2. will be involving other people but still somewhat clean (Kiss x, grab y's tits / crotch over clothes)  
This will also be where clothes start coming off
3. Getting more sexual but keeping in mind there still may be layers of clothes  
eg ( Hand down pants / up shirt for 10 seconds)
4. Hopefully by now everyone will be naked so more sexual related  
(oral sex, eat food of x's privates, etc)
5. at this point we may as well just give up on the games and call it a sex party  
(penetration, go to different rooms for 2 mins) etc

I dont see us getting much past 4 as i expect the night to just dissolve at that point, but would be good to have a bit of variety to help out

Note: Not all dares need to be sexual in nature, eg it could be a "Go to the end of the drive" but if its in level 3 chances are the person is in underwear  
or do jumping jacks, but level 4 so their bits flop about

Looking forward to your input

what do you think about physical exercise this including like: running, practicing any sport, or like dancing, applied to our biology, i mean what does happen that makes sport so good in our body and what biology aspects are those?
I do. So i candy flipped at the String cheese show this past weekend and while I was there I hugged my friend who is a girl from behind. It started out super innocent and kinda lovey dovey but then we started dancing and i got like way too into it, our friends seperated us and she had this look of fear and disgust on her face. We immediately forgot about it and went back to boogying but I can't stop thinking about it, even after I apologized.
I've submitted a couple of updates on this person I'm dating. Basically we've been out three times (I had to cancel on Halloween, if anyone remembers that thread).  We've texted back and forth for about three weeks since we met (online).  She's not a huge texter and last time we hung out (on Monday) we cleared the air on that one (I like to text and I wasn't sure if I was misreading her short answers).

So she tells me on Monday, after we've hung out for like four hours, that she is interested in me. She states she really likes me and is excited about dating me (but we also are taking it really slow...as in no more than hugs so far...even though the last goodbye, we had a more intimate embrace and she was smiling).

All good signs.  She tells me she wants to go dancing soon. I tell her ok I'll see what I can find.

So I text her a fun place to go for Friday night and she says she's taking her kids to the movies (her kids are late teens/20s, fyi) and then states "maybe Saturday."

I asked her today if she just wanted to go for a short walk together (we're both fitness freaks) and she stated she had chores.

And then she was on okcupid this evening. I know because that's how we matched and I got on there and it showed she was on there. 

Now, we aren't exclusive...it's way too early for that. I'm not mad she's on okcupid. I was on there as well. 

But I feel like I'm getting really mixed signals. She likes me, states she wants to date me, has told her friends about me...but has rejected a couple of our dates.

I don't know if all of this is in my head or what.  Does this sound like mixed signals?

I have kids...if they were in their 20s and a woman wanted to go out with my on a Friday night, no fucking way am I going to a movie with them. lol.

Thoughts?  Be gentle. I'm vulnerable right now.
I'll try to keep this as short as possible. 

I moved to a new city after getting a new job and I really struggled making new friends for almost five months. I recently met a really friendly girl and she invited me out to have drinks with her friends, (I'm a guy btw). So I went and she introduced me to her best friend, let's call her Maria. After a couple of drinks I tend to become extremely friendly and that night was no exception. I ended up talking to Maria for a while and I had a really good time. 

Fast forward to the next week and my friend invited me out again for drinks. This time I decided to pregame in order to save some money on drinks so by the time that I got there I was already my super friendly self. There I saw Maria again and I was excited to see her since we had gotten along so well last time. I again end up talking to her a lot that night. At one point after a couple of hours of being there one of her friends pulled me aside and told me how Maria had told them how much she liked me and now all of them were waiting for me to make a move. This completely threw me off since I was just being friendly and was not really interested in anything. 

This situation would have normally been fine. The friend gave me the perfect opportunity to clear things up but instead I panicked and said "Thanks for telling me". Now I cringe at the thought that I could have stopped the whole thing there but I didn't. Now that I'm sober I've been thinking back at my interactions with her and realize that it's my fault that they all were expecting me to make a move. I was so friendly that anyone would have interpreted my actions as flirting. I talked to her almost exclusively, kept constant eye contact, I even asked her out to dance at one point because I like to dance so much.

Now I just feel like the biggest fuckboy and I don't now how to clear things up with Maria without her and her friends thinking I'm a huge asshole.



I'm looking for a song that was sung by a Russian female artist, the song was sung in English and it was kind of House-y. It had 'provocative' dancing in it but I can't remember much else, its really annoying me that I can't remember it. I think it had over 10m views on YT. If anyone can help let me know.


# megafilefactory.info/One Last Dance (2003) 720p BRRip H264 AAC-RARBG [1.17 GB]

This may not be the right sub for this but it's the best I could find

I don't remember much about the show expect for a single part of it which includes what I remember to be a 3d animated purple dancing on stage with lights flashing behind 

I can't remember what the entire show was about but I remember that it would cut to the cat near the end of the show 

I last saw the show in 2004-2005

And I've been trying to remember it since 2015.

So any help is appreciated
