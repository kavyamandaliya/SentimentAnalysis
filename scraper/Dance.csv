So the pilot has to dance around it in a truly tame and tedious fashion, never giving the slightest hint that any of its promiscuous demons from Hell even has genitalia. 
This is diet Hell, at best. HAZBIN's internet counterparts, past and present, had no such limitations.

Having watched "Giants" about a million times right now, I think it's really badass how through the animation and the music, Riot subtly recognizes either the characters' in-game play or their lore and abilities. 

 * Ekko obviously teleports everywhere, and the backwards/reverse reverb in the music in his second verse reflects his ability to reverse time.     
 * Senna sings the hook, which is a reference to how she got hooked by Thresh and trapped in the lantern.    
 * Qiyana does by far the most dancing and motion of anyone, reflecting her status as a high-mobility roaming champion.   
 * Akali's segment keeps blacking in and out of visibility, reflecting her stealth abilities.     
 * Yasuo doesn't say anything, because he's been chat restricted.

It's very deep lore.







I honestly can't remember at this point, but this particular fight has been going on since August or September, and I'm almost impressed by the amount of spite in this woman. Truly, it's incredible. 

After telling her "No" in no uncertain terms, dealing with the flying monkeys, and receiving her non-apology apology text, there was radio silence on both sides. My FH and I are busy with work and friends and life (and planning a wedding) and FH is especially upset about his mom's behavior. I think he wanted this wedding to be a real joining-of-families, and he's realizing the bio-family he has now doesn't make much of an effort to be in his life. 

MIL texted FH a few weeks ago and asked if he would be in \[Midpoint City\] so that she and FH could have a chat, "just the two of \[them\]". It was pretty obvious what she meant - *FH, please let me try and manipulate you away from that horrible YikesDuchess -* and FH replied calmly: "I don't see why I would be in \[Midpoint City\] without YikesDuchess. What do you want to talk about?" Needless to say, MIL did not reply. 

On Saturday, FH received a call from FIL, and at the end of the convo, FIL started in again with "Your mother isn't coming to the wedding unless you invite her friends." Well, I guess she's pretending the non-apology didn't happen either. FH said "It's already been decided," which must have been relayed to MIL. 

On Saturday night, MIL sent FH an email outlining once again all the reasons why we're heartless and cruel for saying no to her guests, none of which are valid. It was set up as both a massive guilt-trip and a call for FH to stand with "his family" (people his mother knows) against "my family", questioned the possibility that FH could even have 100 friends, and finally demanded to know whether my mother and father knew how cruelly we're treating MIL??? The audacity of her last question, when she's said in the past that my family is "brainwashing" and "controlling" FH, is not lost on me. She also threatened to not visit for the holidays, to which my reply was "Was she even invited?"

It's clear to both of us that nothing we say or do will get through to her, because FH had sent a very clear "No" back in September, and nothing about her behavior changed. He told me yesterday that he won't be responding to her, both because it's frustrating and because he's busy (EXCELLENT behavior for a guy who's had a rough time coming out of the FOG).

So at this point, if she does attend the wedding, she will be treated "like any other guest" (FH's words) and not be honored with a mother-son dance, photographs, a toast, etc. So much for bragging about your only child's only wedding, MIL. Plus, it looks like I won't have to see her during the holidays! It's the best Christmas gift she ever got me!

(Thanks also to everyone in r/raisedbynarcissists, the resources have helped both me and FH immensely).





DH and I eloped early October, we had a handful of our closest family and friends tag along. I cannot recommend doing this for those of you who are able to travel, it was such an intimate and perfect day.

Now onto the party!!This past weekend we had a reception in the city we live in, we invited about 120, and about 85 showed up. Here are some details:

**Venue:** This was actually *free*, I happened to have a former coworker who manages an event space and she let me do a trade - I helped her with an event (I have event planning experience), and she let me use the space for the afternoon. The disadvantages of a free space, most likely means you're going to do a lot of the day-of coordination yourself. This lead to me asking several of my family and close friends for help setting up and decorating, but I still almost had a panic attack before we made our grand entrance. Whoops.

**Invitations:** I designed these myself using photoshop, and we used and [e-vite](https://punchbowl.com) service. I wanted to save paper and time, but ultimately, it was a little funky. The e-vite service was cheaper than paper ($95 for an annual subscription), but people got confused and RSVPd with the e-vite, not by going to the wedding website I linked. There was apparently a way to shut off the RSVP through the e-vite, but not after it was sent out.

**Dress:** I wore a modified version of my wedding dress. ordered a skirt off Amazon ($20), and wore the top part of my [dress](https://imgur.com/lcSyRMv). I wore a pair of heels that I'd had for a while but hadn't worn much. It was perfect. (Note: if you buy a skirt from Amazon, remember to steam the wrinkles out ahead of time!).

**Food:** Since our party was mid-afternoon, I opted out of traditional catering and we chose to do a [mega charcuterie board](https://imgur.com/SZ5ylgJ) ($350 that we turned into a shopping date night) and a [dessert table](https://imgur.com/cMDAIkc) ($340). I asked my family and friends to let us borrow their cheese boards and fancy platters etc. Never thought we'd find a use for my great uncle's old china!

Huge thank you to u/MiriHawke for posting their awesome [dessert tier](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/cd1n9d/neither_my_husband_nor_i_are_huge_cake_fans_so_my/) and giving me inspiration for my own! This is what this sub is all about!!! We ordered custom macaroons and cookies, but did less expensive desserts like donut holes, fudge and chocolates from the supermarket. Our Cake was a [cheesecake](https://imgur.com/undefined) from Whole Foods ($20). I made our cake topper myself - two [velociraptors](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0073RQMBY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) ordered off Amazon! These were adorable, and you can get basically any animal.

**Decorations**: Aside from a few party city balloons and pompoms, I framed some 5x7 photos of our wedding, threw out a few greens from a bouquet I liked at the grocery store and [bam](https://imgur.com/YZeF2t3)! People got to experience the elopement with photos I wanted to print anyway. Plus: my cute mom found a bottle of sugar sprinkles I hadn't planned on using and sprinkled it on the high top tables. It was like instant biodegradable confetti! My husband also made a [photo booth](https://imgur.com/AJUCTQw) for us. It was a fairly simple project that involved a couple trips to home depot. We have used it at two events so far, in total I think it cost use about $150.

**Booze:** This was the big one that we thought about a lot. Originally, I wanted to do an open bar, but after checking in on our budget, we decided to go the less expensive option and do drink tokens so we could have a better expectation of the final cost. No one seemed to be bothered by this. We did choose to do signature drinks, I copy catted (is that a word) two cocktails from one of our favorite restaurants: a mandarin margarita and a ginger old fashioned. Both were delicious and kept us around a decent price range... with tax and gratuity it came to about $1800. (happy to provide recipes if anyone wants to try them!)

**Photographer:** I wasn't sure I wanted to hire a photographer (again), but I'm glad I did. I am part of a group on facebook for models and photographers, and a lot of photographers in there are just getting their start, so with amateur photography comes amateur pricing and I picked one I liked and he settled on $200 for 2 hours. This also wasn't "Wedding Photography" so I think the price was less expensive anyway. Personally, I've loved what he's sent us so far, so I will probably send him a tip.

**Band:** I live in a city where live music is huge and everyone knows someone in a band. I went to see a couple of my friends play, loved it and ended up booking them for $500!

**Total cost** was about $3,700.

**Pros of a post-elopement reception:**

* The people who didn't get to see you get married still get to celebrate with you
* We were able to have our dream wedding, without breaking (our) bank
* This option was a lot cheaper, since we didn't have all the "Wedding XYZ" wordage to hike the price up (hate that companies do that)
* We didn't do any of the traditional wedding stuff (no first dance, cake cutting or speeches). This made for a much more relaxed atmosphere where all anyone had to do was eat, drink and dance. This might be a con for some, but this could easily be done still.
* I got to wear (part of) my wedding dress again!!

**Cons:**

* I had to do everything by myself (with DH helping). I think this might vary depending on the venue you get, but from sourcing everything to setting up the tables, it was a LOT of stress, and a heavy mental load.
* I don't think some people saw this as an important event. Despite the effort we went through, some people who RSVP'd didn't show up. One of my husband's closest friend didn't show up because they weren't feeling up to making small talk (heavy sigh).
* Did I mention I almost had a panic attack before we made our entrance?

I feel like all the competitors are portrayed to be on somewhat even playing field, but it’s especially irritating that they are not given the same difficulty level in choreography...

James, Kel and Hannah consistently perform the most technically difficult dances every week, especially James and Hannah. 

Ally has been labeled by the judges as a contender and she is a great dancer, but her samba, in my opinion, was not of the caliber for a contender in the quarterfinals. Her Jazz was definitely better, but I thought the perfect 10s were egregious for the samba . Even Joey commented that there was no samba roll 

Lauren’s quickstep to me was a joke - it was a foxtrot/quickstep fusion at best. Also, the tempo of her dances are so slow and the choreography is of maybe a Week 3-5 caliber... She’s not being overscored, but I  fully believe she expected 10s last night and was disappointed because the judges are never fully honest with her...

I think James is the most superior dancer, followed by Hannah, then Kel/Ally .. I think Lauren is in a tier below them. She was more evenly matched with Kate in my opinion..  am I wrong?


In honor of Harry doing double duty on SNL this weekend, and all of the members (including Zayn) planning on releasing new music in the upcoming weeks/months, I decided to spend this weekend listening to One Direction’s discography in full for the first time (I've only ever heard their singles) and share my thoughts with all of you. While I originally planned on just listening to the music, I ended up taking a crash course in all things 1D. That means watching a 90-minute video of their X-Factor journey, This is Us, countless interviews, and, yes, trying to wrap my head around Larry Stylinson and Babygate. Without further ado, here we go:

Up All Night: This is classic “reality show contestants need to put together something ASAP.” Up All Night is mostly filler buoyed by the genuinely exuberant “What Makes You Beautiful” along with a handful of other fun tracks. As the first major boyband in almost a decade, One Direction (or rather, at this point in their career, Simon Cowell), had to figure out how they fit into the music world of 2011. The boys were given a collection of songs spanning pop-rock, R&amp;B-lite, and AC ballads. Something that genuinely surprised me was just how much of this album was edm-pop, considering they’re largely associated with pop-rock and power-pop. However, it makes sense, as dance music was the sound of 2011. However, WMYB ended up being the big hit, and that was the musical path they decided to continue on for their following albums (let’s just all be happy that Stole My Heart wasn’t their breakout song). Liam’s voice fits this music the best out of everyone, although Zayn and Harry have the best overall voices. Conversely, Niall sounds the most processed (although he and Louis barely sings solos). However, listening to this also makes you realize that, at this point, none of the members had the presence or direction (no pun intended) to carry an album on their own; there isn’t a singular talent on this record that makes you take notice the way that other young, solo artists of the time (Miley, Justin, etc.) managed to do. This is further exemplified by the fact that the three songs the members are credited on (Taken, Everything About You, and Same Mistakes), are some of the worst songs on the record. It was going to take some time for them to grow and develop as artists.

This album shows a marked improvement over their debut, with the band and their collaborators (many returning from their last album) beginning to hone their craft and focusing on the guitar-driven pop which proved to be the sound that resonated most with their core audience as well as the general public. While much more consistent than Up All Night, Take Me Home still manages to contain plenty of filler. Probably the best quality of this album is the improvement of the vocals. There is a sense of assuredness and control to their voices that was not nearly as consistent on their debut. Additionally, the songs they contributed to this time around (Last First Kiss, Back for You, Summer Love, and bonus track Still the One) show great leaps in their writing; none of the songs are amazing, but they show a stronger point of view and ear for melody than before. Overall, a solid album that shows they are capable of growth.

Midnight Memories: This is clearly a transitional album; even the artwork looks like a cross between UAN/TMH and Four/MITAM. The year of this album was also the year that This is Us, a documentary/concert film starring the band, was released. While it showed plenty of light-hearted, fun moments, it also gave a glimpse into how different their world was from the average person. They were consistently indoors, kept in business offices, hotels, or venues with only each other and their team for company. When they did have the opportunity to explore, they were constantly accosted by fans and paparazzi. All of this is to say that the band traded a key period of development for young people (late teens/early 20’s) to be the biggest pop group in the world, and while I don’t think any of them would give it back, it had to have affected them. At this point the band clearly wanted to move away from the clean-cut, preppy teen image they were presented with early in their career. Trading in their J. Crew for tattoos, they were figuring out who they wanted to be, both as people and artists.  By now their collaborators had largely been streamlined to a consistent group that gave them a clear, distinct sonic identity. Leaning into the “rock” side of pop-rock, it seems they wanted this be their “we’re young adults now” album. However, their attempts at maturity largely fall flat, with the exception being “Story of My Life.” The rest of the standout tracks are the upbeat, poppy numbers, with Tomlinson having a writing credit on the best non-single (Stronger).

Four: This album feels like a huge jump in quality, and is also the first album where I didn’t outright hate any song (on the standard edition). On Four, it seems like the band figured out what worked and what didn’t last time, as well as continuing the growth of their songwriting. Whereas Midnight Memories felt like someone making music that they thought was grown-up, Four feels like someone making music that genuinely reflects their experiences. Also, their last album felt like they were focused on how they were being perceived, whereas this album feels like, while they’re aware of their audience and want people to listen to them, they don’t feel self-conscious about the opinions of their listeners and will make music that feels right for them. While Liam, Zayn, and Harry still sing most of the solos, Louis and Niall still have their moments (although they continually give Niall the worst songs…Act My Age? Really?). While their music always sounded contemporary, this is the first album that feels like it’s in tune with what was popular at the time. Still leaning towards pop-rock, the album had touches of 80’s pop (Steal My Girl) and folk-pop (Fireproof). Some of the album tracks lack memorable choruses, but overall this is an engaging listen. While they still have a good dynamic as a group, it also feels like you could hear the potential of the members as solo artists, such as when they take turns serenading on “Night Changes”, or when Styles steals the show on “Stockholm Syndrome”.

Made in the AM: Most boybands don’t make it to five albums, nor are they able to close out with their best work. However, One Direction manages to accomplish both with Made in the AM. Written and recorded in the aftermath of Zayn Malik’s departure, a lackluster, “let’s just finish this” attitude could have resulted in a lesser album. However, the boys decided to go out with a bang, and release their most consistent and mature work. The first two singles, “Drag Me Down” and “Perfect” are both big pop records, with guitars added to give a punchy quality to overall sonic landscape, as opposed to defining the sound. While great songs, they are outliers to the rest of the album, which is a collection of ideas you wouldn’t associate with a boy band seemingly on their last legs. “Hey Angel” is indebted to Brit-pop, and “If I Could Fly” is a genuinely striking piece of piano balladry, which demonstrates huge strides in Harry’s songwriting. “Never Enough” and “Olivia” are two unexpected bursts of pure joy late in the tracklist; it’s great to see One Direction still trying out new sounds at this stage in their career when they could just phone it in. “What A Feeling” is their most straight-forward Fleetwood Mac tribute that they still manage to make their own. The best part of this album overall is that the band members feel grown-up, like real young adults, ready to explore whatever’s going to come next, and that everyone brings something to the table. A group that was put together because the individuals couldn’t stand on their own eventually became a group of artists choosing to come together to make a cohesive and creative body of work.

So, what did I learn from my 1D binge? Apparently it’s possible to become a stan over the course of a single weekend (and also now regret missing the fandom when the band was actually together…but I’ll be here when they go on their inevitable reunion tour!). I always assumed groups like this were primarily filler, and while that was definitely the case with their early albums, these guys had a genuine vision they wanted to achieve with their work, and ended up making some pretty great music.

Okay so I was looking at Poppy's Spotify page, scrolled to the bottom and saw that she's featured on this single by an artist called Charlotte, released Nov 12, 2019 (today).

[https://open.spotify.com/album/04ePoeoLtyVErzEQMiNGDo?si=r14eBrnvSj2kka3pgY-cgw](https://open.spotify.com/album/04ePoeoLtyVErzEQMiNGDo?si=r14eBrnvSj2kka3pgY-cgw)

I'm sure that this song has come out before ([I've seen it on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWQt2MWg72Q)) but who is this Charlotte artist? It's not Poppy's mannequin character since it looks like this artist has been releasing albums since 1999? I don't know, this seems very strange. Can anyone upload a song to Spotify and add Poppy as an official collaborator? Surely Poppy had to approve this for it to show on her Spotify? Why haven't I seen anything about this anywhere online? It looks like a couple of random songs also have Poppy in their credits but Poppy's not actually in the song.

Anyone have any info? So far I've found that this Charlotte makes club/rave/dance music and I think she's Italian. I think she has been previously called Charlotte Quin. Am I missing something obvious?

&amp;#x200B;

Zurii woke up with her face buried in fur. She lifted her head and looked around. “Good morning,” Cecily said, laying on the other side of Johan who was sleeping and breathing slowly. “Well, I guess it’s still night, about four in the morning local time, you two have been asleep for about five hours.”

“Yeah, good morning, it is time to get going?” Zurii sat up but Johan still sleeping pulled her close again. Zurii sighed, “Johan wake up” she tried to pull herself away again but he was way stronger and got pulled back. Zurii looked over to Cecily who was grinning and apparently found this funnier than she did. “A little help?”

“Alright, fine” She smiled and reached up and patted Johan’s cheek. “Wake up fleabag” He blinked and yawned, showing a set of very large teeth. He looked around sleepily and Cecily reached up to scratch under his chin. “Good morning puppy”

Johan huffed and licked her face again. Cecily sighed, “You’d think I’d learn but It’s fun teasing him so It might be worth it.” She said and wiped at her face. Johan stood up and walked over to the upside-down door and opened it to cold wind. He quickly stepped out and closed it, returning a few minutes later dressed.

“I really should have left my clothes in here, the blood froze” He poked at the spot on his clothes where he’d been impaled. “Not to mention there were not exactly toasty” He walked over to Cecily and gave her one of the pack kisses. “Good morning, shall we fix breakfast and I’ll tell you what I found last night”

After a few minutes, they all had cold rations to chew on, “Alright, so I found the compound after running around for a bit, it’s quite well hidden against a large hill and not visible from all sides. I think they have sent most workers home, probably after learning we were on the way. But I did not see anyone struggling to hide evidence or ever doing anything but keeping a lookout”

“So they think we are dead?” Cecily asked and looked to Zurii. “It might have worked”

“Either that or they are just careful” Johan confirmed. “So we can assume everyone remaining is loyal to Voge”

“Right, so we can expect a fight then,” Zurii said and took a bite of her cold ration. “I wish we had some way to heat this thing up. Did you find the clearing we were supposed to land at?”

“Yes, eventually, it is located beyond the compound so from here it’s a bit of a walk”

“And how long of a walk is it to the compound?”

“At my tempo, about an hour and a half, I think, in human form at least” He looked to Cecily, “So two hours maybe if you can keep up with Cel”

Cecily nodded “Yeah, that sounds right, depending on how much snow there is”

“It is not snowing just windy and cold, so the same as when we crashed”

“Alright, about ankle height then, should be manageable,” Cecily said but did not look happy about it.

Zurii felt the same way, marching through snow in two hours with cold winds did not sound very fun. “Well, shall we, it won't get any more pleasant,” She asked and stood up.

“Sure boss,” Johan said and helped Cecily to her feet.

Cecily sighed but nodded, “The sooner we get going the sooner we get to go inside”

Johan opened the door and the cold wind once again blew through the room He grabbed their bags and walked out. Zurii shivered as she stepped outside behind Johan with Cecily bringing up the rear. The outside was dark and Zurii had to wait for her eyes to adjust to see much of anything at first. The sky outside was clear and two moons shed some light on the forest. At least enough to see a few trees ahead, and not lose sight of Johan.

He walked like there was a staked out path through the trees, never seeming to second guess his steps while still looking around. Zurii slowed a little and let Cecily catch up. “He really looks at home here”

Cecily nodded. “Yeah, well if you live in a forest for over a hundred years I guess you would feel comfortable in even alien ones”

“Are the trees here similar to the ones in his forest?”

Cecily looked around “Sort of, these are thicker, both in the trunk and the needles, but it does resemble a pine forest on Earth” She pulled a needle from a low hanging branch and inspected it. “Of course the forest the werewolves live in has trees from everywhere but the tropics and rainforests” She flicked the needle away, “And maybe deserts and the like” A cold wind blew through the trees and both Cecily and Zurii pulled the collars a little tighter.

“Is it just as cold?” Zurii asked and pulled her cap down further.

“Colder sometimes” Johan had waited for them to catch up. “This is about below fifteen celsius I would guess. It usually goes down to minus twenty-five for a bit during the winter.” He looked around. “But not every day like here, the summers are as warm as the winters are cold.”

The ground here had split forming a ridge twice Zurii’s height. Zurii focused and floated up the small cliff. Johan took a step back then jumped and pulled himself up. He laid down and Cecily jumped catching his hand and was swiftly pulled up as well.

“Water freezes at zero degrees celsius by the way and boils at a hundred” Johan added as he walked into the forest once again.

Zurii let her implant do the math and found she would probably enjoy the summer months in his forest. The winters, not so much. “If I do get the chance to see it, we are going in the summer”

“No arguments here,” Johan said and looked back with a grin. “I also prefer the summer believe it or not” He went back to looking ahead “Although this is not too bad”

“Speak for yourself” Cecily muttered.

“You don’t have winter in Faerie?” Zurii asked as she climbed over a fallen tree.

“We do, but winters in Faerie are...” She stopped as another bone-chilling wind blew through the trees. “Winters in Faerie consist of perfect winter days, not to warm, not too cold. And we weave magic into our clothing to shield us from the elements”

“They are coddled,” Johan said from the front. “Even the snowstorms are changed with magic to be pretty to look at and not be too much of a bother.”

Zurii looked back at Cecily who shrugged. “Yeah, he’s right, sort of. Depending on what court you are different weather holds different appeal though, I am from the spring court so that’s when I feel most at home. So no weather is too extreme as all courts work in balance with each other. But on the other hand, living in cities is quite a different lifestyle from the forests, for us, weather plays a smaller part of our life so it’s more of an aesthetic choice, there are many Fae who lives in harsher climates and some that lives where the weather is almost constant, just rain or sunshine.”

“But you don’t like the harsher weather or forest lifestyle?”

Cecily shook her head and ducked under a low hanging branch. “I prefer cities, but as we told you earlier, I enjoyed my time in Johan village last time I was there. But I see that as more of a vacation than a lifestyle”

Zurii nodded and turned back to Johan “And do you like cities, Johan?”

“Sure, in moderation, but cities can be very stressful as I’m sure you are aware. There is always a rush to get somewhere. In...” Johan paused to lift a tree so Zurii and Cecily could pass. “In my home, less so. Sure you still have to work but it’s surprisingly peaceful for being filled with shape-shifting monsters”

Cecily laughed and nodded. “I guess I can agree on that, but different lifestyles suit different people”

“I think that’s the same wherever you go” Zurii agreed. “And how are you finding your way through this by the way?”

“I have a good sense of direction,” Johan said with a shrug. “If you can find your way through magical forests, these prove little challenge”

“To be far I can find my way back to the shuttle,” Cecily said and looked up. “This planet rotates so slowly the stars don’t really move much” Zurii looked up at the night sky. She had never learned how to follow stars but she knew early in her people's history many seafaring travelers navigated by the stars.  

They continued struggling through the forest, well two of them were struggling. Zurii was thankful it had not started snowing at least, with snow up to her knees this would have been at least twice the trip. But still, the hours it would take to get to the compound gave her ample opportunity to think. Mostly about what was going to happen when they got there, plans whirled around in her head, but as she had not seen the place most of them were merely ways to occupy her mind and speculations.

And what would happen after this? Would they go off and track down Voge and take him in to pay for his crimes. Most likely if they did find incriminating evidence the government would pick him up from wherever he was hiding. Then what? Go back to Halo terminal and keep working was probably the wise choice, she needed to properly get supernatural humans into space.

This shifted her focus to her bodyguards. Assuming the assassinations were a one-time thing orchestrated by Voge, would she need them? While they had said they would stay until she released them or died, was that realistic though.

Too many questions ran through Zurii’s head so she instead focused on her current objective. “Johan, anything you can tell us about the compound before we get there?”

“Well, as I said, if they are still running a business it’s a skeleton crew. Otherwise, I assume all of them are Voge’s people. Well I guess they all are but you know what I mean”

“The ones still there probably know about his illegal side” Zurii confirmed.

“Yeah, and at least a few of them were armed. There is a large clearing around the compound so it’s difficult to get close undetected from the front. Where it rests against a hill, or more like where it’s built into the hill it would be easier but more dangerous. Plenty of opportunities to slip and fall”

“So what do you think we should do?”

“Depends what effect you want, with Cecily’s magic we can probably find our way inside without too many problems. Alternatively, we can just kick in the front door and demand to search the place” Johan held up down hands palms up and waved them up and down. “Both options has its advantages”

“While I would like to kick in the door it might be unwise,” Zurii said as the pondered the options.

“I could always sneak in and scout ahead,” Cecily said from the back.

“That might be a good idea,” Johan said nodding. “But the boss decides”

Zurii sighed. “You two obviously have more experience than me, what do you think?”

“Strike hard and fast or sneak in,” Cecily said and caught up to walk next to Zurii. “That way they have less time to destroy evidence if there are any. But assaulting the place without knowing if there are civilians inside is risky in a number of ways”

Zurii nodded to herself mostly and rubbed her temples. “Yeah, you are right, we can't just start shooting without confirmation. I guess we have to walk in the front door, though I would like one of you either already inside or ready to jump in if anything happens.”

“I nominate Johan for sneaking, both because I don’t want to stay outside and I look less threatening,” Cecily said and Johan nodded.

“Sure, I don’t think I can sneak inside but you are right. It probably more useful to trick them into thinking you are no threat, and I don’t mind waiting outside.” Johan confirmed.

Zurii nodded "Yeah, that might be the best choice"

Another hour of walking later and they were closing in on the compound. Johan held up a hand and they stopped. “Alright, a few minutes of walking and you will see the compound. I’ll leave you here and transform. Cecily, can you hold my clothes for me?”

She nodded and accepted his bag. “I guess I have to carry my own stuff for a while.”

Johan grinned as he started to undress. “You’ll live” He stopped once he reached his underwear. “Kiss for luck?”

Cecily rolled her eyes but still walked over and kissed the side of his mouth. “Good luck fleabag”

“Stay safe pixie” Johan turned to Zurii. “Alright boss, are we ready?”

“Ready to walk up to several armed criminals, what could go wrong?” Zurii sighed and nodded. “Yeah, we are ready”

“Sarcasm boss? be careful you don’t end up like us,” Cecily said while laughing.

“Yeah, that would be a disaster,” Zurii said while smiling at them.

Johan chuckled and stripped fully before changing forms. Cecily shouldered the bags and they started towards the compound with Johan trailing behind just out of sight. “Why do we keep acquiring weapons for Johan when he never uses them?” Zurii asked quietly when the thought hit her.

Cecily paused for a second before laughing quietly, “You know what? good question, maybe he just like guns. And speaking of Johan I need to talk to you about the battle if it comes”

“And what about him?”

“Well, just that fighting alongside a werewolf is an experience, which is, to say the least, frightening if you are not used to it.”

Zurii frowned “I have seen him fight several times you know”

Cecily looked at her with a serious expression, “Have you?”

Zurii opened her mouth to answer but stopped. During the first attack, it had been too dark to see anything, and when she had been taken she had just seen the aftermath. When she had fought alongside Droni Johan had thrown one assailant at a kinetic and bit one in the throat but otherwise done nothing like the first two attacks. “You might be right, I have not seen much of what he can do”

“You have been in war and I know you can handle it, but it’s quite a bit different from a shootout.” Cecily searched for words for a minute. “Johan is strong enough to tear limbs from anyone he meets, or rake his claws through muscles and bones, and he probably will, so it will be messy. Not to mention what I said before about him being scary when he goes on a rampage”

Zurii nodded and thought back on the first attack. She had been across the street and still, when Johan just jumped back she had drawn on more power by reflex. “Alright, I’ll keep that in mind”

Cecily nodded and smiled “As you said to Droni, he is still the same fleabag inside, as scary as he seems.”

\[“Error”\] Johan said from somewhere behind them in the forest, Cecily grinned.

“What did he say?” Zurii asked her and looked back but saw no sign of Johan.

“Just how much he appreciates my company” Cecily smiled at her.

“Sure he did” Zurii looked ahead and was faint light through the trees. “I think we are getting close”

“Agreed,” Cecily said and put a hand on Zurii’s shoulder stopping her. “I want to try something” She turned Zurii to face her and focused. Zurii saw Cecily’s glamour drop before slowly creeping back, but this time she looked very different. Her skin turned green and her hair twirled into braids, her two eyes split into four and a tail appeared behind her. Suddenly a Cerral that could be a cousin to Zurii stood in front of her. Cecily looked at her own body and turned around. “Well? how do I look?”

“Like a Cerral,” Zurii said looking her over. “Why didn’t you tell me you could do this?”

Cecily shrugged, “Mostly because I did not know if I could, or more specifically how hard It would be. It’s relatively easy to look human, and by that I mean like someone other than how I usually look, but I can’t mimic most supernatural creatures. I can’t look like a werewolf for example” she unpacked her rifle and changed it to look like a long bag.

“Huh, well this will be useful I hope, might throw them off if they know about you two,” Zurii said and she started walking again. A moment later they were standing on the edge of the forests overlooking a fenced-in compound. Inside were a large building and two landing pads. A large building stood built into the hill behind it just like Johan had said. And like almost all factories on Glaceria, there were plenty of lights to keep the long days of darkness at bay.

Zurii looked it over but came to the same conclusion Johan had. Either approach from the front gate or the hill which looked slippery and steep. Probably to deter anyone trying to infiltrate. “Well, we are not getting any younger” Zurii said looking to Cecily. “But I guess you two are not getting any older”

Cecily smiled, “Correct, but I am getting colder”

Zurii smiled back and nodded, “Let’s go then” She quickly set her implant to record.

They both stood up and walked towards the front gate, behind which an Ozuik sat in a guardhouse looking bored. When they entered the light he looked up and stood, and with a weapon in hand walked out and over to the gate. “Who’s there? this is private property.”

“Zurii Viasma, from Halo terminal with a warrant to search this facility,” Zurii said and glared at the guard.

The guard's eyes went wide and he quickly contacted a superior by Zurii’s best guess. Zurii tensed and prepared herself to pull up her barrier but to her surprise, he nodded and opened the gate. “The foreman is inside the main building, please use door number three” He pointed to a door next to a large gate.

Zurii glanced over to Cecily who looked a little confused and raised an eyebrow. She turned back to the guard. “Alright, thank you for your cooperation” They walked on towards the building. Like Johan had said, everything looked abandoned, with no one around except guards every now and again patrolling the grounds. In fact, they only saw three from the time they approached until they reached the door. Zurii placed a hand on the handle and met Cecily’s eyes. “Well, ready to walk into whatever is on the other side?”

“Sure, what could go wrong?” Cecily said and grinned. Her mouth stretched a bit unnatural for a Cerral. Zurii took a deep breath and opened the door stepping in.

Inside the room was a lot darker than the lit outside and Zurii had to take a moment to adjust. Cecily walked in behind her and looked around. The door slammed shut and Zurii looked back before glancing at Cecily who was looking further into the building. “Uh oh, trap,” she said quietly.

Light suddenly flooded Zurii’s vision and she closed her eyes to not be blinded. She opened them slowly and look over the still factory. On the ground floor where she stood a loading space was set up with boxes of whatever was produced here. Two ramps on either side led up to a raised section that looked to span the rest of the building, and walkways ran along the walls over them.

On the raised section stood about twenty armed Cerrals and Ozuiks. All carried mag guns of different sizes with a larger mounted gun in the center and a familiar Cerral standing with arms crossed beside it. “Welcome to my factory Miss Viasma,” Voge Kheeni said with a wide sweep of his arms. “Nice of you to stop by”

“Pleasure is all mine Mr. Kheeni, we seem to have some business that needs attending,” Zurii said and smiled a fake smile.

“That we do, and it will be so much easier now that you decided to pay a visit yourself” he sneered.

“Keep him talking if you can” Cecily whispered to Zurii and she heard Cecily start to whisper while recognizing the language as that of magic.

“Oh, how so?” Zurii asked Voge while putting on a confused face.

“You are here for a reason are you not?” Voge said, failing to hide the contempt in his voice.

“Yeah, I am here to conduct a investigation on the behalf of the Cerral government. Would you mind showing me around and explaining the facility” Zurii said while looking around the factory. “What is it that you do here?”

Voge paused for a moment before his expression turned hostile. “Do you think this is funny Viasma?”

“Not particularly, I don’t like the cold very much” Zurii answered with a shrug.

“You think I don’t know you have linked me to the attacks and your kidnapping?” Voge almost spat out.

Zurii faked a shocked expression, “Really? you were behind it, I would never have guessed. Well since you have now confessed I going to need to take you in”

Voge briefly got a confused expression before breaking out into a laugh. “That’s not going to happen” He pulled a gun from his holster. “Unless you brought substantial backup that is” His crew joined him in laughter. “I don’t even see your humans I heard rumors about”

“Rumors?” Zurii asked and scratched her chin, “Whatever do you mean?”

“I heard silly rumors that your humans could transform into monsters, but perhaps that’s on me for hiring drugged up gang members to do my dirty work”

“Oh, I see,” Zurii said with a small laugh, “Of course no video has made it here already, only voice messages and text, yeah that’s a silly rumor” She felt Cecily nudge her and noticed she had stopped whispering to herself. “Only one of them turns into a monster”

Cecily put two fingers in her mouth and blew out a loud whistle. Zurii put a hand to her ear and noticed many of the guards flinched. Cecily dropped her disguise but kept her glamour up. Voge looked shocked to see a human standing beside Zurii carrying a rifle.

“Hello!” Cecily waved at him “I am the one who does not turn into a monster” She dropped her glamour, her hair turned blood red and flowed like liquid and her skin turned snow-white, her green eyes shimmered like fire. “I am the nice one”

A roar came from outside, clear even through the winds. “And that’s the monster,” Cecily said and raised her rifle just as Voge raised his gun.

A lot happened at once. Zurii raised her barrier as Cecily shot one Ozuik that was carrying a large mag rifle. Voge shot Zurii’s barrier and the one on the mounted gun pulled the trigger, \*click\* He looked down at the gun which had not fired. Cecily shot a Cerral carrying another of the rifles and stepped behind Zurii as rounds began hitting her barrier as a loud crash was heard from outside.

Everyone started shooting and Zurii moved to the left towards the closest crates. Cecily was behind her the entire way and shot one more as they moved. Voge was shouting at the Cerral trying to fix the mounted gun. “Your work?” Zurii asked Cecily.

“Yep, good job making him talk, what is he, a soap opera villain or something?”

“I don't know what that means,” Zurii said as she flung a crate at the guards. She ducked down, “I can’t block many more shots, there are too many guards,” She said as pieces of wood flew around her when the crates were struck by rounds. Luckily the content absorbed the mag rounds and none hit her barrier for the moment.

“Well,” Cecily said and looked towards the large gate, “wait for it…aaand now!”

The thin gate shook as another roar was heard. Then with another slam, Johan burst into the building, tearing parts of the gate clean off. He roared and broke out in a sprint towards the guards, who turned their guns towards him. At least those who were not frozen from shock or fear. Cecily stepped out and squeezed off a few more shots with Zurii right behind.

Zurii floated out and picked up a crate just as Johan landed on a screaming Ozuik and ripped his head off with his teeth. She had to push down the fear response that tried to make her run. Johan threw the corpse at another guard and pounced with more screaming from his soon to be victims. Zurii tore her eyes away from him and looked around for Voge.

He was backing away, his gun raised towards Johan with fear in his eyes. Zurii ran towards him and threw a small crate trying to knock him down. He saw it coming and ducked throwing a cylinder of some kind towards Zurii. She closed her barrier off against both sound and air and closed her eyes just before the grenade exploded. She had guessed right and was not blinded as the stun grenade went off. But as she opened her eyes Voge shot her with a large rifle he had retrieved from behind a crate.

The rifle, Zurii saw too late, was one made to fight Kinetics. It fires a focused laser and could not easily be diverted with a barrier. Still, Zurii managed to shove herself to the side catching the beam in her left shoulder rather than her chest. She screamed in pain and managed to slam Voge with the crate she had thrown, before falling to the side and failing to keep her barrier up. She hoped the beam had not hit any large arteries or at least cauterized them on its way through.

She slowly with gritted teeth got to her feet to see Voge stumbling up, looking stunned and almost falling over. She tried to focus her power but just managed to grab his leg and sent him down to the floor again. Looking back showed her Johan who was still rampaging through the guards with disturbing efficiency. But he was slowing and blood coated his fur, much of it looking like his own and Cecily was trying her best to support him, shooting and ducking behind crates.

Zurii looked back to Voge and walked up the ramp while trying to keep from passing out. She reached the top of the short ramp and saw Voge reaching for the rifle once again. She instead pulled at his mag gun with her powers, which were not quite functioning but the gun slid over instead of floating to her hand. She had to stop the gun with her tail to keep in from falling off the raised platform. Picking it up she turned as Voge got hold of the rifle and aimed it at her. She was faster and pulled the trigger, but missing her mark and instead hit the gun. Voge flinched just as he pulled the trigger and the beam hit the wall, missing Zurii by an arm's length.

She shot again and hit him in the leg this time. He cried out and dropped the gun. Zurii approached but stopped at a safe distance, “Throw the gun away” He glared at her but grabbed the gun and threw it down the ramp. Zurii spared a glance over her shoulder and saw the battle was winding down.

Blood was all over the place, with body parts scattered around. Johan was standing over a body and breathing heavily. Cecily walked up to Zurii and tossed human-made cuffs to Voge. “Put those on, and behave” Voge’s expression shifted between fear and anger but he complied and cuffed himself, the cuffs folded over his hands leaving his wrists tied together and his hands covered.  

Cecily walked over to Zurii and inspected the wound. “This needs some serious attention” She looked over to Voge who was bleeding slowly from his leg wound. “And while I don’t care if he lives or dies maybe we should check on his leg as well when there is time” She looked back to Johan who looked over to them before taking a stumbling step and them falling over. “Shit,” Cecily said and ran over to him. Zurii followed and they reached Johan who was face down on the floor and panting slowly. “Do you still have that medical kit?” Cecily asked Zurii.

“In my bag,” Zurii said and Cecily ran over getting it. She opened it and emptied it on the floor.

“Don’t worry too much, he is really hard to kill, but I don’t want to take chances” She picked up all the remaining stimulant syringes which turned out to be five, and one after another injected them into Johan’s leg. “If one did nothing maybe all will” Johan’s breathing quickened and he blinked, jerked and coughed up blood. Then he rolled over to his back and transformed back into a human. He flexed his hands and blinked again.

“What did you just inject me with? my entire body feels like...” He shook his head and coughed again.

Cecily leaned down and kissed him, Zurii saw lights passing between their lips. “All the syringes, I’ll dig out the rounds in a minute” Cecily stood and walked over to Zurii wiping blood from her mouth as she went. She gently grabbed Zurii’s arm and placed her hand over the wound.

Zurii felt heat on her skin as more sparks danced under Cecily’s palm, “What, no kiss for me?”

“You don’t have internal injuries but If you want one...” Cecily licked her lips.

Zurii smiled and then winced as she accidentally moved her arm, “You know what, maybe later, my arm is distracting me”

Cecily smiled warmly “I’m glad you're alright Zurii” She kneeled and picked up the medkit. “I’ll make sure the megalomaniac over there does not bleed out”

Johan waved a hand “Yeah, just leave me here, I’ll be fine” he said sarcastically.

Cecily rolled her eyes and looked pleading to Zurii, “Can you help him? without hurting your arm any more”

Zurii nodded “This is not my first time being shot unfortunately, I’ll live, especially with your magic” She walked down and grabbed Johan's bag placing it down next to him. She grabbed a towel and placed it over Johan's waist.

“This is almost like the time we met,” He said smiling, the coughed up some more blood. “Though these ones had bigger guns and better aim”

Zurii smiled and looked him over. He had multiple wounds on his stomach and chest, most had stopped bleeding but some still slowly pulsed out blood. “Yeah...” was all Zurii could say as she pulled out a bottle of water and tried to wipe the blood from him. She ignored the bodies lying scattered around and breathed through her mouth to not smell the carnage. “Just a bit messier”

Johan closed his eyes and nodded. “Yeah, sorry about that...I can get kind of...”

“Scary?” Zurii said and wiped the blood from his face.

“Yeah...” He said and looked at her. He was almost looking afraid to hear what she would say. Zurii noticed Cecily had also stopped and was listening.

Zurii sighed and then leaned down to kiss the side of Johan's mouth. “I might be insane but I have enjoyed my time you two more than the last few years working in the government. You two might be scary but there are no other bodyguards I’d rather have. I’m not going to throw you away if you don’t want to leave.”

Johan grinned at her then sat up with a grunt. He gently grabbed Zurii’s face and kissed her back. “Welcome to the pack Zurii”

Cecily came back and gently hugged her avoiding her wounded shoulder. “I’m happy you feel that way boss”

“This is all very touching but...” Voge started to say before Zurii and Cecily both aimed their guns at him and he shut up.

Zurii stood up and walked over to him “And for you, I have some people very interesting in what you have to say, and hear your confession I recorded.”

Cecily and Johan broke out into laughter. “Zurii you genius” Cecily said while laughing. “You even got him to admit it himself, oh you are fucked,” She said to Voge and laughed again.

Zurii looked around and found a com unit in a small office at the side, she called the codes she’d used in the crashed shuttle. Cecily had followed her and was taping her wounds shut. The laser had burned a hole right through her shoulder. “This is Captain Vortu, identify yourself”

“This is...ow! Zurii Viasma, I would like transport from Voge Kheeni’s compound, I have him in custody with a confession concerning two assassination attempts and one kidnapping with attempts on my bodyguard's lives.”

“Understood miss Viasma, a shuttle is on the way, two hours out. Anything else?”

“That will be all Captain, thank you very much for your assistance”

“No problem, Captain Vortu out” He cut off the call and Zurii walked out with Cecily into the main hall. Johan was standing and picking mag rounds out of his stomach.

Zurii walked over and held out a hand. “Here, I’ll help you”

He smiled and handed her the pliers. “Much appreciated miss” Zurii rolled all four eyes and went to work.

When Captain Vortu arrived with his squad they were sitting on crates just inside. Johan had healed and dressed and Zurii had her arm in a sling. They had gagged Voge as he would not stop trying to insult them. Zurii nodded her head to the Captain as he stepped inside, identifying him by his badge and marks on his chest. “Captain Vortu I presume, here is the criminal. And I suggest no weak stomachs when checking out the rest of the assailants.” Zurii said with a serious expression.

Vortu looked over her shoulder and nodded. “Get someone to identify the bodies and no weak stomachs!” He shouted to his men. “Do you need medical attention Miss Viasma?”

“No, thank you very much, just a ride to the closest spaceport. I want to go somewhere warm”

“I thought you promised you, mother, to have us over for dinner?” Cecily said teasing.

Zurii sighed as Johan helped her down and out towards a shuttle. “That I did...well I guess that vacation will have to wait”

Them doing this more chill sitting and interacting with each other, kind of like how 1D concerts used to be, looks really forced (the opposite of what it was meant to do)

Give the boys their coreos back. They look uncomfortable, like they don't know what they should be doing.

The funny thing is that SM obviously is doing this to make them likeable by western public when the west is leaning more and more towards choreographs. For example the new simon cowell group auditions requiring dance abilities or Ariana and Taylor doing coreos on their shows
Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy (January 23, 1998 – June 18, 2018), known professionally as XXXTentacion[a] (/ˌɛksˌɛksˌɛksˌtɛntəˈsjɒn/),[10] was an American rapper, singer and songwriter. Although a controversial figure within the hip hop industry, Onfroy has been regarded to have left behind "a huge musical footprint" due to his impact on his young fanbase and his popularity during his short career.[11] The most notable aspects of his appearance were his tattoos and his distinctive half-colored hair, which was inspired by the One Hundred and One Dalmatians antagonist Cruella de Vil.[12]

Born in Plantation, Florida, Onfroy spent most of his childhood in Lauderhill. He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center[13] and started his music career on SoundCloud in 2013,[14] where he soon became a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s.[15][16][17] Onfroy rose to mainstream fame with the single "Look at Me" which is now certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[18]

Onfroy's debut album, 17 (2017), debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard 200, receiving a mixed response from critics, some of which lauded the album for its personal narratives and diverse musical style. On August 15, 2018, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. His second album, ? (2018), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with its singles "Sad!", "Changes" and "Moonlight" all reaching the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, and the album was certified Platinum. In the week following his death, Onfroy's highest-charting single, "Sad!", went from 52nd to 1st on the Billboard Hot 100, making him the first artist to top the Hot 100 posthumously since The Notorious B.I.G., with "Mo Money Mo Problems", in 1997. A few months after his death, he won the Best New Hip Hop Artist at the BET Hip Hop Awards and won the Favourite Album-Soul/R&amp;B for 17 at the American Music Awards.[19][20] Onfroy's third studio album, Skins, was posthumously released in December 2018.[21][22]

On June 18, 2018, Onfroy was fatally shot at the age of 20, in a robbery at a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida.[23] The attackers fled the scene in an SUV after stealing a Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000 from Onfroy; four suspects were arrested and are currently awaiting trial.[24] On June 18, 2019, one year on from Onfroy's death, an official documentary on his life was announced. It will feature footage of Onfroy from before his death telling biographical details. At the same time, Onfroy's estate announced a new posthumous album.[25]

Early life

Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy was born on January 23, 1998, in Plantation, Florida, to Jamaican parents, Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy and Cleopatra Eretha Dreena Bernard.[26][27] XXXTentacion has stated he has Egyptian, Syrian, Indian and possibly Italian ancestry in an interview on The Beat in 2017.[28] He had three siblings with one being half, shared paternally.[29] XXXTentacion was mainly raised by his grandmother Collette Jones[30]—due to his mother's personal problems[31]—in Pompano Beach, Florida, and Lauderhill, Florida. When Onfroy was six years old, he tried to stab a man attempting to attack his mother[31] and was eventually put into a youth program before being forced[clarification needed] to live with his grandmother.[27]

XXXTentacion's interest in music initially started after his aunt persuaded him to begin attending school choir and later church choir. He was soon kicked out of the school choir after attacking another student.[10] XXXTentacion attended Margate Middle School[30] from which he was later expelled after a series of physical altercations. He was subsequently enrolled into Sheridan House Family Ministries by his mother for over six months.[10] XXXTentacion began to listen to nu-metal, hard rock and rap during his time at Sheridan House Family Ministries, which led to him to learn the piano and guitar.[31]

XXXTentacion attended Piper High School until he dropped out in the tenth grade.[32] He described himself as a "misfit" during that time, citing how quiet he was despite being popular and regularly involved in physical confrontations.[33] XXXTentacion was not the athletic type and said that he was insecure and depressed during his time in high school.[27]

Career beginnings and "Look at Me" (2013–16)

XXXTentacion's career as a music artist began in June 2013 after the release of his song "News/Flock".[14] While in juvenile detention for gun possession charges, he met Stokeley Clevon Goulbourne,[34] another artist known as Ski Mask the Slump God. During their time together, XXXTentacion and Goulbourne became good friends and began freestyling.[35] Recalling his time in detention, XXXTentacion said that he was respectful to the officers and staff and used to protect people from other inmates, including a homosexual cellmate, whom Onfroy later attacked for allegedly staring at him while he was changing clothes.[10][36]

That same year, following his release from a juvenile detention center, he and Goulbourne met up again under the belief they were going to commit a string of home invasions for monetary gain[37] though XXXTentacion eventually bought a Blue Snowball microphone and began recording music,[35] which convinced Stokeley to do the same. After Onfroy adopted the moniker XXXTentacion, he uploaded his first official song, called "Vice City", on SoundCloud.[38] Speaking on his decision to abandon a life of crime for music, Onfroy said that he felt like music was a better outlet for his feelings and then-girlfriend Geneva Ayala was someone who helped him realize that.[27] He would then continue uploading small snippets of his songs that he would either soon release or keep unreleased. Onfroy eventually joined Ski Mask the Slump God's group Very Rare, before breaking off and starting the Members Only collective, which Ski Mask then also joined.[13] The word "tentación" in his stage name is the Spanish word for "temptation".[39][40]

Onfroy released his first official extended play (EP), called The Fall, on November 21, 2014.[41] In 2015, Onfroy released a collaborative mixtape with Ski Mask the Slump God, Members Only Vol. 1, before releasing Members Only Vol. 2 with several members of the growing Members Only collective. On December 30, 2015, the original version of "Look at Me" was uploaded to the SoundCloud account of the song's co-producer, Rojas.[42]

On April 28, 2016, Onfroy released the EP Willy Wonka Was a Child Murderer,[43] with music heavily inspired by heavy metal and indie music. In 2016, Onfroy quit his job as a call center operator due to his growing music career[32] and moved in with rapper Denzel Curry.[44] In July 2016, Onfroy was arrested and charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.[45][46] After posting $10,000 bail, Onfroy continued to work on his debut independent album, Bad Vibes Forever, which had a slated October 31, 2016, release date.[27] The album missed the release date and was delayed due to Onfroy being arrested in early October on charges of false imprisonment, witness tampering and aggravated battery of his pregnant girlfriend.[47]

Release from prison, Revenge, 17, and A Ghetto Christmas Carol (2017)

In 2017 "Look at Me" gained traction, peaked at number 34 on US Billboard Hot 100 and the top 40 of the Canadian Hot 100.[48] The single helped him gain more popularity due to accusations of Canadian rapper Drake using a similar rap flow in his song "KMT".[49][50] During his jail stint, Onfroy signed a deal to be managed by Soloman Sobande (who would remain his manager until his death) and despite Onfroy being in jail during "Look at Me"'s initial breakthrough, major-label scouts began offering six-figure contracts and Onfroy eventually signed for Empire Distribution for lower royalty rate, full creative control and a smaller upfront payment.[51][52]

After his release from prison on April 18, 2017, he released three more songs on SoundCloud.[53] In an interview with WMIB, Onfroy announced that he was working on the studio albums Bad Vibes and 17; as well as a mixtape, I Need Jesus.[54][55] In an interview three days after his release from prison, Onfroy said to XXL, "I got this really, really, really good album called 17. That's more of an alternative, R&amp;B sound—then I've got this mixtape called I Need Jesus, which is mainly rap and the underground sound I did."[56]

Onfroy announced his first nationwide tour on April 28, 2017. The tour, titled "The Revenge Tour", had 26 tour dates overall and generated much media coverage, included that of a rapper being assaulted,[57] Onfroy being knocked out after an altercation on stage,[58] an audience member being stabbed,[59] Onfroy being thrown into a barricade by security,[60] and Onfroy punching a fan.[61] He announced the cancellation of the rest of the tour dates due to his cousin being shot on June 24, 2017,[62] though the final tour date in Broward County, Florida, still went ahead[63] and was later streamed on the watchthemusic (WAV) app.[64]

Onfroy was named as the tenth pick on XXL's "2017 Freshman Class".[65]

Onfroy released his debut solo mixtape, Revenge, on May 16, 2017. The mixtape consists of eight previously released songs.[66] The collaborative mixtape, Members Only, Vol. 3, with Members Only, was released on June 26, 2017.

Onfroy's first opener for a major act happened when DRAM brought Onfroy out at a concert on April 9, 2017 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles during Kendrick Lamar's DAMN. Tour.[67]

Onfroy released his debut album, 17, on August 25, 2017.[68] The album debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard 200, selling 86,000 album-equivalent units first week.[69] The album received a mixed response from critics, some of whom lauded the album for its personal narratives and diverse musical style.[70] On September 3, 2017, Onfroy announced that Bad Vibes Forever, his second album, was still in production.[71] 17 gave Onfroy's seven songs—"Jocelyn Flores", "Revenge", "Fuck Love", "Everybody Dies in Their Nightmares", "Depression &amp; Obsession", "Save Me" and "Carry On"—that debuted in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 31, 77, 41, 54, 91, 94 and 95, respectively. Jocelyn Flores became Onfroy's highest-charting song since "Look at Me", which peaked it at 34.[72] Onfroy then had his ninth song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, in turn with his being featured on Kodak Black's song "Roll in Peace", taken from Project Baby 2. The song debuted at 52 and peaked at 31, matching "Jocelyn Flores."[73]

On September 12, 2017, Onfroy released his first official music video for his 2015 song "Look at Me", as well as sharing a music video with his 2015 song "Riot".[74] The song generated controversy hours after being posted due to the video depicting a white child being hanged by Onfroy, as another black child observed. The music video was removed from YouTube months later.[75] Onfroy's label, Bad Vibes Forever, signed a distribution deal with Capitol Music Group subsidiary, Caroline, on October 19, 2017. The deal, reportedly worth $6 million, was for one album only.[76] Shortly afterwards on October 25, 2017, Onfroy announced he was terminating his contract with Caroline[77] despite a representative confirming he was still signed.[78] Two days later, he announced that he was retiring due to negativity and backlash[79] though some publications noted that Onfroy made similar statements before and not followed through.[80] On October 30, 2017, Onfroy announced that he would make music again if fellow Broward rapper and "former best friend," Ski Mask the Slump God, was his friend again.[81] Later, Onfroy answered a fan's question on Instagram Live about his retirement, saying, "Am I quitting? Yes, I'm quitting—I don't know for how long, but I'm just not going to make music right now."[82]

On September 21, 2017, Noah Cyrus released her single titled "Again", featuring Onfroy's vocals.[83]

Onfroy previewed new music on November 2, 2017, signaling a return to making music.[84] Onfroy announced a new album titled Bad Vibes Forever on November 17, 2017,[85] speaking on the album, Onfroy said "It will be a mix of genres you have seen me dabble with, if you are not a fan of me this is not an album for you, it is for core fans only".[86] The album title shares its name with his label.[87] On December 11, 2017, Onfroy released the A Ghetto Christmas Carol EP on SoundCloud.[88] A day before his hearing for witness tampering charges, Onfroy announced that he was preparing three albums to be ready for 2018,[89] and after being released on house arrest, he announced the titles of all three albums, Skins, Bad Vibes Forever and ?.[90]

The dance-hall inspired[126] track was the first song released from the upcoming album, "Bad Vibes Forever, which is releasing in Fall, 2019.[127]

On October 21, 2019, the song "Hearteater" was officially released by Onfroy's estate.[128

Onfroy had two half siblings – an older sister named Ariana and a younger brother named Aiden.[129][130] Onfroy lived in Florida and lived with rapper Denzel Curry and producer Ronny J in the past.[44][30][131] Before his death, Onfroy was moving into a 6,000-square-foot (560 m2) mansion in Parkland, Florida, which he bought, in November 2017, for US$1.4 million.[132] In February 2018, Onfroy posted on Instagram that he was preparing to return to school[133] and went on to announce in March 2018 that he was going to a community college to get his GED.[134] Onfroy was public about his struggle with depression.[135][136][137]

Onfroy's ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala has accused Onfroy of torturous abuse. According to Ayala's statement, Onfroy beat her at times, choked her, broke clothes hangers on her legs, threatened to chop off her hair or cut out her tongue, pressed knives or scissors to her face, and held her head under water in their bathroom while promising to drown her.[138] “His favorite thing was to just backhand my mouth,” Ayala says. “That always left welts inside my lips.”[139] The first incident of domestic violence occurred when Onfroy slapped Ayala and broke her iPhone 6S, because she had complimented a male friend on his new jewelry, Onfroy later repaired the phone.[140] In one incident recounted to a prosecutor, Ayala said Onfroy asked her which object she wanted him to force into her vagina: a long-handled barbecue fork, or a wire barbecue brush, she chose the fork and Onfroy told her to undress. Onfroy was lightly dragging the tool against her inner thigh when she passed out, he did not penetrate her with it.[141][140] Onfroy would often guilt her with near-attempts at suicide. Ayala said he used to fill a bathtub with water then fetch the microwave and dangle it over, threatening to let go. Another time he reportedly dangled himself from a 12th-storey balcony by his legs and threatened suicide again.[142]

Before his death, Onfroy entered a relationship with Jenesis Sanchez.[143] Three days after his death, Onfroy's mother announced on Instagram that Sanchez was pregnant with his child.[144] The baby was confirmed to be a boy on August 22, 2018,[145] and his family had confirmed that it was Onfroy's wishes to call his child "Gekyume" if it were a boy and Xiorra if it were a girl[146][147] after a word his father made up meaning "a different state or next universe of thought."[148] Gekyume Onfroy was born on January 26, 2019, three days after what would have been his father’s 21st birthday.[149]

Gun possession charges in 2014

In 2014, Onfroy was sent to a youth detention center for a year on gun possession charges.[13][10] According to Onfroy, during his time in detention, the district attorney was attempting to try him as an adult for gun possession. Charges which Onfroy said, would have had a sentence of 5–10 years in prison.[10]

Robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and home invasion charges in July 2016

In July 2016, he was arrested and charged with robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and home invasion.[45][46] According to the arrest report, Onfroy entered the home of Che Thomas with three other people, armed with a firearm. After pistol-whipping Thomas three times, Onfroy escaped the home with an iPad, an iPhone, a Sony PlayStation Portable and $20.[150] Onfroy was arrested in Orlando originally until he was transferred to Orange County.[27]

False imprisonment, witness tampering, and domestic abuse charges in October 2016

After posting the bail of $10,000[151] in early October of the same year, while awaiting trial, the rapper was arrested again later that month on charges of false imprisonment, witness tampering, and aggravated battery of a pregnant victim.[47][152] On March 26, 2017, Onfroy was released from jail on bail[56][153] while facing charges of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. His trial for aggravated battery of a pregnant victim was originally going to take place in May 2017 and was pushed back several times, and was set to take place on October 5, 2017.[154] On September 8, 2017, Pitchfork leaked the testimony of the victim in Onfroy's aggravated battery case.[155] The trial was then delayed again[156] with a date of December 11, 2017, announced.[157] Controversy arose once again following Onfroy's choice to donate $100,000 to domestic violence prevention programs,[158] and then further when Onfroy announced an event to support rape victims though it was later canceled due to vandalism.[159]

Onfroy's mugshot in December 2017

Onfroy's trial was delayed again after an affidavit was filed asking for the charges to be "completely dropped".[160] The victim in the case also declined to testify in court. In reaction, the prosecution moved to split the case into two, with witness tampering charges filed against Onfroy and a new trial date announced for December 15, 2017.[161] On December 10, 2017, Onfroy posted a message to Instagram, writing "Court date is on the 15th 9:00 am here is my court information, if I am taken into custody, I want to tell everyone I've let down I apologize, I tried my best, I really did ...";[162] he then released the information of the court hearing.[163]

Onfroy pleaded not guilty on December 14, 2017, and was taken into pretrial custody after a motion was filed by the prosecution on the grounds of Onfroy having violated his bond.[164] He was held without bail.[165] It was confirmed on December 20, 2017, that Onfroy was being released on house arrest.[131] Onfroy was released from house arrest on March 21, 2018.[166]

Snapchat video controversy

Shortly after being released from house arrest, a Snapchat video surfaced of Onfroy hitting a woman in 2013.[167] Onfroy's attorneys claimed the video, which features a caption written by the woman that sardonically reads “I hate this nigga” along with Onfroy dancing to some music before striking the girl, was "obviously ... in jest".[168] Onfroy claimed afterwards that he was afraid he was going to be financially extorted by the woman and that members of her family had already called him requesting money.[169] The woman shown with Onfroy in the video came forward several days later saying she was "terrified for her life";[170] however, according to TMZ, Onfroy intended to sue the woman for fraud and defamation after her family allegedly demanded a large sum of money in exchange for her silence.[171] The woman later released a statement saying that the version of events described by Onfroy was correct, and that she "hope[d] that people see the video in the playful context in which it was recorded and nothing more".[172] His domestic abuse charges, which he was awaiting trial for, were dropped following his death.[173]

Leaked audio of confession to domestic abuse and a stabbing incident

On October 23, 2018, Pitchfork released secretly recorded audio of Onfroy talking with acquaintances around the time of his October 8, 2016, arrest. In the recording, he allegedly confessed to domestic abuse, and described an incident in which he stabbed nine people.[174] The tape was considered a confession by both the prosecution and defense.[174][175] One especially fraught conversation about Onfroy’s ex-girlfriend took place on the afternoon of October 26, 2016 when he told a woman, “I already got what I wanted, I already bashed her face—her face on the internet, bruh, I done made her look bad on the internet, bruh.” Later that day, an audio clip from the call was posted on Instagram of Onfroy saying he “bashed her face” without the hurried clarification.[176]
On June 18, 2018, Onfroy was leaving the Riva Motorsports motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida, and, at 3:56 p.m., was blocked from exiting the car park by a black Dodge Journey SUV. Two armed men exited the SUV and approached the rapper while he was sitting in the driver's seat. A brief struggle occurred, and the armed men reached inside Onfroy's vehicle, stole a small Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000, and shot Onfroy multiple times. The shooters fled the scene in their SUV and Onfroy was transported by paramedics to the nearby Broward Health North hospital in Deerfield Beach, where he was pronounced dead.[177][178] Onfroy's death was announced by the Broward County Sheriff's Office at exactly 5:30 p.m.[23][179] Suspect Dedrick Devonshay Williams of Pompano Beach was arrested two days after the shooting, shortly before 7 p.m. Held in the Broward County jail, he is charged with first degree murder without premeditation.[180] In the weeks following the event, three different people were arrested for their actions involved with the event, including trigger man Michael Boatwright.[181]

In his will, Onfroy named his mother Cleopatra and brother Aiden as the sole beneficiaries of his estate. Onfroy's future child, with whom his girlfriend at the time of his death was pregnant, was not named in the will as it was written before the pregnancy.[182]

Funeral

An open casket service for Onfroy took place at the BB&amp;T Center in Sunrise, Florida on June 27 where fans were allowed to pay their respects.[183][184] His private funeral took place on June 28 where rappers Lil Uzi Vert and Lil Yachty and singer Erykah Badu were among the attendees.[185] He was entombed in a mausoleum at Gardens of Boca Raton Memorial Park, Boca Raton, Florida.[1][186]

Well known for his "depressing, and at times devastating"[135] music that brought attention to mental health,[187] XXXTentacion employed styles and techniques that were unconventional in hip hop during his career, such as distortion[188] and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals drawing inspiration from third-wave emo.[189] This influenced fellow artists such as Lil Pump, Trippie Redd, Ski Mask the Slump God, Smokepurpp, Comethazine and 6ix9ine with the lo-fi mixing of his early career.[190] He was also credited with giving artists their first taste of fame and helping them with their careers through features and co-signs.[191][192][193] Onfroy left behind what Rolling Stone called "a huge musical footprint" due to his impact on his young fanbase and his popularity during his career.[194] Given his immense influence only to die young, the article compared his cultural impact with that of Ritchie Valens and Darby Crash.[194] The most notable aspects of XXXTentacion's appearance were his tattoos and his distinctive half-colored hair, which was inspired by The Hundred and One Dalmatians antagonist Cruella de Vil.[195]

On June 18, 2019, exactly one year on from Onfroy's death, an official documentary on his life was announced; it will feature footage of Onfroy from before his death telling biographical details.

Controversy

Onfroy's success as "a zeitgeist-grabbing, industry-defying, boundary-destroying phenomenon" is "overshadowed" by his reported abuse of his ex-girlfriend, and the latter is the focus of his life story.[194] Nonetheless, the article[clarification needed] contends that despite media attempts to suppress him, Onfroy's "impact on music will be felt for years to come" and his recordings have "helped signal a new era of post-streaming, post-genre teenagers".[194] Onfroy's personal life and history are also noted as prominent parts of his legacy.[135][194][196][197] An article in The Guardian described his legacy in more critical terms, stating that "[h]e will be remembered mostly for the unusually cruel violence he committed on vulnerable people, particularly his ex-girlfriend, crimes for which he never expressed remorse."[135] According to the article, his music "reflected a life lived with disregard for humanity, both other people's and his own"; and rarely attempted to engage in bravado or bragging, instead focusing on "mental illness, suicide, extreme misogyny, and a prevailing feeling of numbness."[135]

An article in The Atlantic expressed similar criticisms, though it also noted that Onfroy "reminded young fans in particular that their hurt was valid but that it did not form the sum total of their lives" and that he "gave voice to their insecurities."[196] Contrasting these elements of his legacy, the article acknowledged that though he spent his career encouraging young fans to recognize their greater worth, Onfroy's legacy is nonetheless characterized by the trauma he both experienced and caused.[196] In The Washington Post, Chris Richards commented on Onfroy's complicated legacy, contrasting how he "encouraged his fans to find hope in the fog of their despair, but bragged enthusiastically about the joy he felt in brutalizing others."[197] According to Richards, Onfroy's music "brought solace to the depressed" while validating the sort of violence he practiced and legitimized the pain of his fans while erasing the suffering of domestic violence victims.[197] Onfroy's music serves as an example for Richards of how "a hateful song" might normalize such feelings in "hateful people," which contributes to the profound paranoia in society about the hatred that might be in the minds of others.[197]



My natural personality is straight forward and direct. So my first day at the club, I literally go up to men and say “hello how are you today? I’m Kitt. May I sit with you? Are you here for a dance? Vip is $40.”

My boyfriend coached me on how to talk to men, I bought a stripper course on IG, I been watching stripper movies (haven’t seen hustlers yet!), and it started leaking into my daytime job.

My boyfriend caught me talking to our boss and he said I sounded too cutesy like I’m at the club. I figured out how to do the make-them-feel-good but with more assertive voice for work.

Today, EVERYONE has noticed I am different. One of the top level people said out loud in front of everyone “Wow! Kitt is really an example of servant leadership today!”

A client came into the office for me and when he left he called me back and said “I just have to say, I am so impressed with how you speak. Everything you say just makes sense and I really appreciate it”

My manager usually does not smile but he has been smiling every time I walk by.

My boyfriend said he is noticing a night and day difference about me and it can feel my energy affecting the office. I can’t believe this... 

Stripping is the kind of job I’m supposed to be ashamed of. But with its additional income and now making me a recommended advisor at work — shit!! This thing might change my life!

I don’t know if this has ever been said before but I wish I had started stripping sooner!!

P.s. I work in a male dominated field but I think it works on the women, too. I have gotten good feedback from girls today, as well.


I mean remember GOT. 

Charles Dance looks wrong, but everything else is so right because he’s an incredible actor that nails the essence. Same goes with Lena Headey and Nikolaj Costar Waldau to some extent. None of them have the golden hair-green eyes combo because they’re there to act the part not just look the part. 
Bran and Robb looked too Stark like while in the books they have Tully auburn hair. But they were good actors. 

We’ll see if Anya Chalotra is near as good as the rest, and that’s the most important thing. More important than how she looks. I really don’t see why it’s worth throwing a tantrum over?
This is a lot more petty than most things on here, but it’s been getting me down recently and I just wanted to write about it. 

Me and my mum started doing tap lessons at the start of the year. Awesome fun, we haven’t done anything together for ages. Our relationship has been pretty strained for years so it was nice to spend time with her that was happy. 

I did dance as a kid and I do it casually now, so it was really easy for me. Compliments from the teacher, don’t really have to practise, other students would follow me for advice, etc. Mum struggled a lot more. I tried my best to show her moves and help. I was really loving it and made a point of never thinking it was too easy for me - I tried hard to do everything as perfectly as I could and tried not to get cocky. 

She first started getting critical when I was trying proudly (stupidly) to show off a step I’d learnt to my brother. Instantly it was “that’s not totally correct, your toe wasn’t lifted enough, etc.” and her turning away with mouth pursed. I was bummed but tried not to show it. 

Then came comments at class, and sour looks. One day the teacher pulled me aside and suggested that next semester my mum and I could move up from beginner to intermediate. I mentioned this in passing to my mum. 

She protested so much, coming up with every single excuse under the sun why I couldn’t go up to intermediate. Some people had been in the beginner class for years (the same ones who never tried and treated it as a social group), intermediate was ridiculously hard (it wasn’t, plus why would it matter if it was?), and basically I was told that I just wasn’t good enough (this stung a lot, I’d been trying even harder recently). I rebutted her points and she finally went silent for ages and then just started crying. Finally it came out that she thought the teacher had said only I should go up to intermediate, but I’d clearly said it was me and her. 

Tap stopped being fun after that. I’d really loved it, really enjoyed doing something that came naturally to me, but now I was constantly critiquing myself and never felt good enough. The rational part of me knew the constant criticism was her being insecure, but my self-esteem was pretty shot at this point and I didn’t have the energy to fight back. 

The last thing that prompted me to stop was because she’d started doing extra tap lessons on Monday nights with the same teacher, and I had a few Monday nights free when I’d normally have music rehearsals. I made a comment about how it’d be nice to come along on Monday night, maybe, and her exact response was “well, maybe not. I mean, you have your music stuff, and I have this.” At that point I knew for sure she wasn’t worried about me moving out of a class we were doing together or anything like that. She just didn’t like seeing me be better at something than her. And that stung so much because christ, this woman is supposed to be my parent and she’s acting like a child, putting me down because she can’t stand feeling inferior. 

So I left the next term, and I haven’t done it since then. Tap brings no joy to me anymore, at least not when she’s around. 

The real kicker is she’s actually improved a lot since then, better than me. Maybe a couple of months ago I had more Monday nights free, and she asked me to come join her. I repeated what she’d said to me and her reply was “what, no, I only said that because I thought you were busy on Monday nights” (which is a total lie, because she knew I was free otherwise why the f would I be asking?) Recently she’s been talking about how the teacher and other students still ask after me. 

I don’t have the heart to tell her I left because she made me feel so shitty. Tap makes her happy and gives her a hobby, and I haven’t seen her really indulge in a healthy hobby for years. I don’t have the heart to take that away from her. But I’m still terribly sad that I gave up something I loved, and it’s only added to the long list of small things that have made me resent her over time.
I listen to Rachael Sessions and Misk’i Takiy for traditional stuff. I also love Soundcloud mixes for other, more dance focused tunes (Desert Dwellers and such). I would love some more recommendations if anyone has.  Thanks!

Hello again, Freelancers,

I come to you a day later than usual, as Monday was a studio holiday for those of us in North America. This past week plus was a fun one. Being able to celebrate the #N7Day with all of you, even just in a small way in the world of Anthem, is a testament to the long history of BioWare games both behind us and ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

[Did you get a chance to check out some of these Mass Effect inspired armor sets? Let us know which one is your favorite!](https://preview.redd.it/xwfcuz34gby31.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf27b38b35b401f96f8538b3e697385c1e29de76)

We also shared the next story at the end of last week, a tale confined within the walls of Fort Tarsis, but one more spectral and haunting in nature than the past ones. What happens when those who have fallen decide not to let you forget about them?

&amp;#x200B;

[Dusty's Deal](https://preview.redd.it/fxcfwim9gby31.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593f8f84bfe24de6795ec0db0970f8bcdc05362b)

How true the story of [***Dusty’s Deal***](https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/lore-dustys-deal) is and how concerning it should be is up to you. It’s certainly something that stays on Max’s mind during the dark nights of the Season of Skulls, though she may not readily admit it.

(M20) Yeah there are some annoying kids on it. But don't you get that with every game? What game doesn't have whiney 12 year olds in the lobby.

I'm not saying i'm going to go buy a fortnite t-shirt and yes a lot of the dances make me cringe but it's a free game, that is a lot of fun and can be casual with a competitive element if you wanna go down that route. And you can't deny that it's a fun game to play and gets constant updates unlike the majority of games, yes some of the updates are shit but they're often rectified pretty fast. Practically everyone played it and now that it's become un-cool everyone is just hating on it all of a sudden and acting like they weren't playing it during its hype too.

The other thing is some of those escape rooms are actually so much fun. You can see people have put hours and hours into making puzzles, parkour and original escape room ideas with some pretty cool visuals all in one. Plus it's created by the community. If you don't enjoy those, then you probably haven't gone online with a group of friends got high or had some drinks and tried to get out of a prison or a haunted house. It's really chill and a lot of fun.

So yeah, i get there are annoying kids on it but i think a lot of people are just jumping on the bandwagon and saying they hate it because it's un-cool now but don't have any real legitimate reason for hating on the game.
She stops everything to dance to it at the end of that episode.


It's a movie review for the movie Dances with Wolves (1990), and I think it'd be fun to take suggestions for a title. It does not have to be remotely serious, so long as it doesn't have any swearing in the title and is vaguely related to the title of the film

Edit: Just told my teacher that I'm doing this and she supports it so go hogwild
# On Stage: Prologue

The piano music playing in the beginning is Claire de Lune by Claude Debussy

# Dope

When the boys are dancing together during the second chorus, there are banners with German writing on the wall behind them. The red one says " Keine Profite mit der Miete," meaning "no profit with rent," and the white one says  “Friede den Hütten! Krieg den Palästen!” meaning "peace in the huts, war in the palaces. [Here is a link to a German Army's explanation of these phrases.](https://aminoapps.com/c/btsarmy/page/blog/dope-mv-the-story-behind-the-german-slogans/o3RZ_73wSdu7XBw2anVZ45k0j0jLgvj3gkB)

# Fire

\-The scene where Suga shakes hands with a hooded man is a reference to the album cover of Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd. [https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m0ofUWYXL.\_SY355\_.jpg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m0ofUWYXL._SY355_.jpg)

\-The scene where Jungkook sits on a trash can and watches a burning bike roll past is a reference to the movie Lost River. You can also see the words Lost River spray painted on the door on the left.

\-This might be a stretch but I think the scene where they iron Jin is a reference to the lyrics of Save Me, "Thank you... for ironing me who was wrinkled."

# Spring Day

\-The train is a reference to the movie *Snowpiercer*. RM's rap in the beginning also mentions the Snowpiercer.

\-The motel that is shown is called Omelas. This is a reference to the short story *The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas* by Ursula le Guin. 

# Serendipity

It's not confirmed, but some people think this music video is based on "The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. 

# Blood Sweat and Tears

\-The entire music video is based off of the book *Demian* by Herman Hesse. It contains a lot of imagery and themes from the book, and the quote that RM reads during the cut scene is also from *Demian*.

\-The music that plays at the beginning is "Kyrie," from Mass in B Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach.

\-The statue with no arms is Venus de Milo, and the black statue is Perseus with the Head of Medusa by Benvenuto Cellini. 

\-The painting that Jin stares at is *Fall of the Rebel Angels* by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.

\-When V is sitting on a balcony and appears to jump into a painting, the painting is *Landscape with the Fall of Icarus*, also by Bruegel the Elder. It's very hard to notice, but this painting is also in the blue/purple room with the fallen chandeliers where the whole group is in the beginning. It's hanging on the right wall. (You can see it a bit more clearly when Jungkook is floating in the same room at 3:44).

\-Both Breugel paintings are in the BS&amp;T Japanese's music video too.

\-On the side of the floor when transitioning from RM's room to Jimin and Suga's room (pause the video at 3:13), there is a label that says Chatroom 2,3 ↑. This is a reference to the movie *Chatroom,* but I'm not sure about the 2,3 then up arrow. The room that Suga and Jimin are in, with the glass squares on the floor and a door behind them, is also similar to a scene from *Chatroom.* [*https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NzVt82RU5elq\_WnDpw0xlDuCdo3GVz85w0\_vCTAVlTW5lECA2Ny44YOWY6UJ2Ui4mC\_av8kRxjdORWMNGbErS4PZUX0FwfrKMw=w1600-rw*](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NzVt82RU5elq_WnDpw0xlDuCdo3GVz85w0_vCTAVlTW5lECA2Ny44YOWY6UJ2Ui4mC_av8kRxjdORWMNGbErS4PZUX0FwfrKMw=w1600-rw)

\-The statue in the background of J-Hope's solo scenes is the Pieta by Michelangelo. 

\-The song that Suga plays on the organ is *Passacaglia in D Minor* by Dietrich Buxtehude. In Demian, there is a character that plays the organ and is specifically mentioned playing Buxtehude.

\-As Jin goes to kiss the statue, on the wall there is mirror and above it the words “Man muss noch Chaos in sich haben, um einen tanzenden Stern gebären zu können. (You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star.)” This is a quote by Friedrich Nietzsche, who is also mentioned in Demian.

\-The statue that Jin kisses is Abraxos from Demian.

# Unknown Artworks from BS&amp;T

 If anybody could help me with these I'd be very grateful. 

\-All the statues/photos of statues, save Venus and Perseus, in the very beginning "museum" scene. 

\-In the next scene, where they sit on the coach, there is a painting on the ceiling (more easily seen at 3:43), a painting behind them (also at 3:43), a painting propped up on the floor next to Jin (more easily seen at 2:17), and a painting of a horse that's slightly visible behind the left curtain. The painting on the ceiling is also in the Japanese music video when J-hope and Jimin are dancing (It's not a Bruegel tho, I checked).

\-In Namjoon's room with the antlers, there are some books on the mantle. Also there's a desk with a painting of what I think is a Madonna and Child, but there are so many Madonna and Childs in the world that I can't tell which. There's more paintings on the walls and two photos statues on the floor as well.
Hi! Im Roland Tings, I'm a music producer from Australia. I use a lot of synths and drums and weird sounds to make dance music. I just put out my new album Salt Water and im currently working on putting together my brand new 2 piece live show. Im keen to answer any questions you have about production, creativity, synths, sound design, performance... anything!

You can check out my album here:

Shout out to that beautiful girl from Venezuela, thank you for dancing with me on day 3 at neon garden during fisher set. You are gorgeous and you totally made my day. 

Sorry for not taking a photo with you or not asking for your number.. my phone was stolen and I was too shy when you were dancing with me because you are absolutely gorgeous!

Hopefully I can see you again and next time I’ll dance with you all day long!

I don't know if this is a sign of depression or what, but when I do things I enjoy, I enjoy them but ultimately feel like I am wasting my time.

Examples:

1. Video games. Been a hobby of mine for as long as I can remember. I love playing great games with good stories and I enjoy it while I am doing it, but say I spend 2 hours playing something. Afterwards, even though I've had a great time, I feel like I've wasted those two hours.
2. Reading. Love to read. I am usually reading four books at a time,  but same as above. I spend a few hours reading and even though I thoroughly enjoy the activity I left feeling like I've wasted those hours reading.
3. Playing music. I play guitar and can get lost hours in playing, but you know the song and dance now.

Everything feels empty, but I don't feel depressed or sad. In a weird way, while I am doing the things I enjoy I am always seeing other things I could be doing and enjoy, but then I see others things I could being doing and enjoying. I  seem to be a constant loop. I feel like I am running out of time. 

I am deciding to be better and looking for ways to break this loop.
1. Their human and humans can have their bias affect them without intending to. The Judges appear to like Ally, and this are more prone to de-emphasizing her mistakes, and having a greater appreciation for her success.

2. For scores 1-8(and sometimes 9) they appear to judge on scale such that someone with more dance experience is looked at more critically with higher expectations. I’m more ambivalent to this than most, but a lot of people really don’t like this idea. In this context Ally set herself up early as a non-dancer.

3. It’s a show, shows have producers, producers gonna produce. Like while to a large extent I trust the judges integrity, I think it’s foolish to not at least consider the producers try to thumb the scales on occasion. This can come in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. 

4. They may be scoring accurately, and we don’t get to see that. Remember judges are scores are done when the dances ends, not after critique, so if a judge have locked in their score no matter how it goes. Also people who go to the show live get to just see the dance, no camera to make it look better or worse. So it may really be the score though the screen is actually different the score seeing it in person.




my first trip was very intense, and it’s been 4 days since then. i went through extreme happiness to extreme anxiety for about 6 hours, i was shaking, twitching, laughing, nauseous, dancing, screaming, crying. just wanting it to be over, but also enjoying it. it probably would have been considered a bad trip, but i feel like im finally free of all of the things that were weighing me down. anyways, my sleep has been weird, i wake up and feel like i’m tripping in the middle of the night, feel anxiety/scared, then it goes away. i just took a nap because i’m pretty tired, and the whole nap i felt like i was just running around in another world. i could feel everything in my body, all the muscles. having 1000 thoughts at once. does anyone have any advice or thoughts to make me feel better? i want to be able to sleep again :)
I can't remember much about it, only one lyric, which sounded like, 'I got you lady'.
And the music video was set in a dark room kinda looked like some weird experimental lab maybe? The guys looked like they had cybernetics under their skin or something?? and there was a dance scene in it where they each had a chair and they danced around them. I thought it was shinee but I could be wrong, also this was YEARS ago like, at least 15? would love to find it again as it was my first kpop song. thanks!!
Is it lame people, is it cheese tactics? Ness?

No, is bad connections.

I main Inkling, and movement is to Inkling what inputs are for Ryu and Ken.

I need to move constantly, jumping and fast falling, and dash dancing to bait things out.

Playing Offline this is easy, I feel in total control of my character.

But when I play online... Oh gosh, that's like playing with a potatoe.

I can't react to ANYTHING, because when I try to move to move to left or right, when I try to land, whenever I try to punish something...

That little input lag appears, you must know what I mean, that 0.25 seconds that literally ruins the gameplay. experience...

And even if the match doesn't get cuts, that little input lag just makes me mad, because I feel that I'm playing lame.

I wish the fixed that, so whenever you get matched against someone, there wasn't any input lag when you play.

And believe me, it's possible, I play always online, and I have found people which connection was PERFECT.
This album is ok. But it is is sooooo far from their pop \*creep roots. the main problem that i have with this album is with thom yorke. why would he try to copy a genius like gary barlow? give me a break. this guy is helpless and clueless, and the people who buy this album have the same size of a brain this guy has. nd I'm not joking. there's like 1 good song on it, the rest are trash. he sounds like a pre-teen girl when he sings and his songs suck. throw this in the garbage. this is certainly one of the worst albums ever made in recording history.this guy can neither sing or dance. His voice sounds like a little wisp, sort of like a short breezes that dies after it hits a big tree. If you ask me, Gary would sound much better singing these lyrics. Overall the songs and the production are not bad, almost any other male singer could make these songs decent. His voice is high pitched and doesn't work well with guitar contemporary music. His is best suited to well-crafted Dance-Pop music. I strongly suggest you listen to samples from the CD, as to avoid dissappointment. With this cd in print, I started to shiver, my palms started to sweat, and my ears swelled in torture. Arrest the man who gave this band a record deal. It is a crime against humanity.
I really adore those folk music sounding but still belonging to the classical music category pieces, also I am a violin player so listening to them is exceptionally enjoyable for me. Can you guys recommend pieces like them? Thanks in advance.
Just want to share my experience with you all. 

I split off from my friend and stayed at neon garden by myself on the second day because none of them are into techno. I got pick pocket and lost my phone about 30 mins after they left (around 4:30. screw you thefts!)

Knowing my phone is gone and it’s not coming back, I just try to relax and let it go and enjoy the show. Bart Skils was phenomenal! What a great set that brings every one bouncing and dancing! The lightings were spot on and so much emotions at neon garden. Everyone was having a blast!

But during that set a guy near me also got his phone stolen. I feel you man cuz I lost mine just an hour before you. It’s gone. Just let it go and enjoy the show. We will learn this lesson and protect ourselves better in the future shows!

Big shout out the the local girl (I think her name is Sierra), knowing that I lost my phone, taking care of me for the rest of the night, fanning me fresh air and gave me some water when mine was out. Too bad I don’t have my phone to save your number. Thank you for showing PLUR. 

TLDR
Got my phone stolen at neon garden at 2nd day afternoon. a girl took care of me for the rest of the night and turned the horrible experience to a wonderful one. But still, screw you thefts!
Disclaimer: The ultra analysis book rankings I used were as they have been up onto the Wikia, thus they may be slightly dubious alongside the fact that although Horikoshi wrote this so probably a lot of the information is more a ball park figure or straight up humor. This post will also get very long.

How the numbers work in my table
-------------------------------------

On most character pages there were "statistics" for characters. Each character was given a grade that corresponded to a number:
**S** (6), **A** (5),  **B** (4),  **C** (3),  **D** (2),  **E** (1).

A few of the grades included +/- but still associated with whole numbers so two characters could have a 4 but one would be a B+ and another a B-. To account for this I changed the numbering to reflect the +/- by adding or subtracting 0.5, i.e. **B+** (4.5) and **B-** (3.5), which is not how they appear in the book.


Categories 
--------------

In the Ultra Analysis Book there were **5** Categories but only **4** of them am I counting in the ranks, those are:

* Power

* Speed

* Technique

* Intelligence 

Obviously the exact meaning of each category may be speculated as each is probably a broad catchment to accommodate various sub types.  

I sum up the values of these 4 categories to get a total 'Score' and that is their overall placement when everything is taken together. 

The fifth category in the Ultra Analysis book was a joke category (I can imagine Horikoshi being chuff over "Got your back" as it's both a term of teamwork but also he literally was holding on to Shishida's back) that I have included under 'Other' after the 'Score'. For a majority of characters their 'Other' score was high but for those with low scores I have accounted for that in the description e.g. Poor Aura. 

Finally I used Excel to calculate the ranks as many characters had equivalent scores and it gives a interesting impression of how the characters 'block' together in terms of different strengths.

--------------------------------------
So if you have been following my storyline of sorts, last Saturday I went to a dance with my crush, and everyone’s advice was very valuable. We had a great time there, but we have not talked since. She has stared at me in class and we are friends on Snapchat and Instagram. We are both in band together, but I don’t know how to really talk to her because she is SUPER shy in school but comfortable everywhere else. Thanks for reading my super long rant!
I actually get goose bumps when Mother Aughra is singing (and dancing to) the song of Thra.
Maybe I'm being weird and just hyper-fixating on things and this is in no way meant to dismiss all the positivity I have seen, but I feel like Kel could literally perform a miracle onstage AND do a perfect-score worthy dance and 65% of the comments would still be dismissing him as a non-contender/ somehow on par with some of the weaker dancers and at this point in the competition, I'm confused? Is this because he featured in the Bottom Two or ???

Last year, I received Just Dance 2019 for free and I found myself enjoying it a lot. So much so that I purchased 2018, 2014, 2015, and this year 2020. I even purchased a subscription to the unlimited service for a period. Unfortunately nowadays, I find myself becoming disillusioned with the game due its lack of music diversity. It's way too NA and EU centric. In 2020, I couldn't find one African song or a middle Eastern song and less than 5 Asian songs? That's like half the world's population being under represented. I even looked at the unlimited service to see what was available and I was sorely disappointed. Tbh, I guess I'm just a little salty after being severely disappointed with the song selection in Just Dance 2020. If I could refund the game, I would.

It's been amazingly intense so far, only now feeling it's starting to fade a bit but, anyone to talk in the meantime?
I've gotten back into dancing and had my second evening working at the club. Made a grand!! The bartender said it was a slow Sunday so I'm looking forward to more of these nights though I know they wont all be this succesfull (or maybe they will?) I've finally gotten some confidence in who I am as a dancer and that's been helping a lot. Good luck to you all! &lt;3
But I can say it here yeeg. Basically I can impersonate Louis Potgieter (the main dancer in Dschinghis Khan) in almost every song that the band Dschinghis Khan made a dance for, and some people actually thunk it looks cool but I think it looks retarded and it would be even weirder and more awkward if people who I know irl knew it
Like the title implies, I'm learning Spanish and am interested in recommendations of cities/schools to do an immersion-like program with. I'm finishing up about a month of Spanish classes in Medellín, Colombia at the moment (which I've really enjoyed!). From there I will be doing a few weeks of normal travel. Then I would like to set myself up for about a month stay in a city in Mexico to do some more classes. Any recommendations on cities/schools in Mexico? So far the most interesting to me are Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Oaxaca.

Things I'm interested in doing besides Spanish classes while in Mexico:  
\- Salsa dancing  
\- Eating the amazing Mexican food  
\- Hiking  
\- Decent amount of younger people around to hang out with (I'm 26), including sampling the dating pool  
\- Coffee  


Thanks in advance for any help!

Does anyone have the vid of trippie dancing in the shower to a snippet I’m the background really need to listen to it coi is in it if that helps
***There are spoilers ahead - for these two episodes as well as future episodes. Keep that in mind.  Also, I am posting this early because I'm thinking we need to reduce the time between watches and discussions. Let me know if that's a problem.***

  

**Episode 5 “The Wolf and the Lion”**

Remember last week when Jon Arryn’s former squire was killed in a joust against the Mountain? Yeah, well, Ned is just a tad bit suspicious of it and wants to do some investigating of his own. He asks Ser Barriston about the young man’s family and then he asks about who determines the draw for joust opponents. Ned also wonders how the man, a former squire until recently, could afford such a handsome set of armor.

Ned goes to see King Robert, who is verbally abusing Lancel Lannister. Ned tells him he’s too fat for his armor and then Robert tells Lancel to go get the breast plate stretcher – as if there is such a thing. Ned tells him he has no business jousting and you get the feeling Ned will tackle him to the ground before he let him joust. Robert starts complaining about being married to Cersei (really, what man wouldn’t) and they go off to watch the jousting. 

The Knight of the Flowers, Loras Tyrell, gives a red rose to Sansa who is sitting in the stands and I don’t know about you all, but I think him and Renly are a bit friendly. Sansa better not get her hopes up of marrying him instead of Joffrey (although he would’ve been better than Joffrey regardless). She’s worried for him going against the Mountain but he actually beats the Mountain because the Mountain’s horse was in heat. I’m not sure what that means in this world of jousting, but it leads the Mountain to cut off the head of his horse and attack Loras, both of which were totally uncalled for. Here comes the Hound to face off against his brother – these two want to kill each other, obviously, but the King puts a stop to it before it happens. Loras is grateful to the Hound for him saving his life and raises his arm in triumph. The Hound barely tolerates it and looks like he'd like to be anywhere but there.

We find Lord Tyrion on the road, still a prisoner of lady Catelyn. They’re not heading to Winterfell or King’s Landing…they’re going to the Vale, to Catelyn’s sister. Tyrion tells her she’s changed and tries to convince her that he’s not guilty. Then they are attacked and one man, Bronn, is fighting very well. Tyrion appears ready to hop on a horse and flee, but then a man threatens to kill Catelyn and Tyrion uses a shield to kill the man, saving her life.

Nevertheless, they head to the Eyrie to bring Tyrion to justice. Tyrion is riding next to Bronn and tells Bronn they say the Eyrie is impregnable. Here, Bronn retorts, “Give me ten men with climbing spikes and I’ll impregnate the bitch.” These two are gonna be friends, I think.

Back at Winterfell, Bran is being given his lessons by Maester Luwin. Bran is upset his mother left Winterfell, saying she can’t protect the family if she’s not with the family. He’s got a point. He’s upset, too, that he won’t ever be able to shoot an arrow, until Luwin tells him he can learn to do so from a saddle like the Dothraki boys.

We return to King’s Landing, where Arya is chasing cats and Ned is talking to Lord Varys. Varys tells him the King is a fool and is doomed unless Ned saves him. Varys says both him and Ned are men of honor – and that the Tears of Lys poisoned Jon Arryn. He doesn’t know who gave it to him but mentions one boy, Ser Hugh, the dead squire. So who paid the squire to give the poison? The why is easy enough – he started asking questions, Varys says.

Meanwhile, Arya has chased her cat down into the bowels of the castle where the skeletons of dead dragons rest. We see Varys walking through with the man from Pentos that helped Dany and Viserys, Illyrio Mopatis. They know Ned is asking questions and that the Wolf and the Lion will be at war soon. Illyrio wants to know why this Hand can’t die, too, because they’re not ready for war. Of course they’re not…as far as we know, Drogo still has his Khalasar far, far away from King’s Landing with little incentive to go to King’s Landing. Arya runs to go to her father but her way is blocked by a gate so she runs down some stairs. She ends up outside the castle and has a hard time getting back in because she’s filthy. Ned is not happy but she tells him about overhearing the conversation mentioning his death. They have to stop talking when Yoren from the Night’s Watch comes in and tells him that Catelyn has taken the Imp. We’ve known this a while, but he hasn’t.

Varys finds Littlefinger in the throne room, staring at the throne made of swords. It’s a nice chair and all, but I need a few pillows under my tushy and behind my back to be even remotely comfortable in it. Do you think Littlefinger is thinking of himself on that throne? Lord knows, I’d love to run him through with one of those swords…

They start talking about, of all things, the predilections of various lords when they visit Littlefinger’s brothels. Seriously, they are having this conversation. 

Littlefinger lets Varys know he saw him behind closed doors with Ned and, later, with Illyrio. They’re both threatening each other but they’re doing it in a very dignified way…until Renly comes in and informs them King Robert is coming for the Small Council meeting. Apparently, that’s a rare thing. They learn Dany is alive and pregnant. Robert wants her dead and Viserys as well, but Ned doesn’t want to give in to the assassination of a woman and her unborn child.

Remember last week, when we saw Jorah leave quickly after being told of Dany’s pregnancy? Yeah, he’s spying on her. Ned doesn’t care because he doesn’t think highly of Jorah and his information, but Littlefinger sticks up for him in a way. Robert wants to know what happens if she has a son, but Ned tells him the Dothraki won’t cross the sea – they never have. But this is an argument Ned is not going to win. Even Renly wants her dead…but then, he has ambitions of his own.

But Ned refuses and will not follow Robert if he kills this girl. To emphasize his point, he drops the pin the Hand wears on the table and tells Robert he thought he was a better man. Robert tells him to go back to Winterfell and he starts packing and tells Jory to help the girls.

Littlefinger comes for a visit and tells Ned he can bring him to the last person who spoke to Jon Arryn. Ned goes with him, telling Jory to meet him in the stables with his best men and to make sure there are guards on the girls. I’m screaming at the television right now. “Just get the hell out of there!” They don’t listen.

Remember when Tyrion asked Catelyn how long it had been since he’d seen his sister and tells her that she’s changed? Yeah, she’s gone round the twist. She is not happy Catelyn brought the Imp to her, which we get to hear from her high perch where her son is…breastfeeding. I’m not sure how old this boy is, but I do know he shouldn’t still be breastfeeding. It’s a bit…weird. Anyway, Catelyn is just staring at her as she accuses Tyrion of killing Jon Arryn, too, and little Robin wants Tyrion to fly…out of a door in the floor. But they put him in the Sky Cells instead – they have no door on them and are, well, in the sky. It makes me a bit nauseous.

If there was any question about Loras or Renly, it’s dispelled when we see Loras shaving Renly while Renly complains about his treatment by Robert. He tells Loras Robert is going to kill the Targaryen girl – and he’s going to go hunting. Meanwhile, Loras begins telling Renly he ought to be king – people love him because he’s kind to them. Renly is fourth in line – he has three kids and one brother ahead of him. You start to think that’s not going to matter.

Cersei visits Robert and we get an interesting conversation between the two, where they talk about the Targaryens, strategy, and their marriage. It’s a good insight into these two characters. Such a good scene by these two actors, really first rate.

Ned is in a brothel – again – with a woman holding a little baby who happens to be another one of Robert’s bastards. Ned tells her the child will want for nothing. He wants to know why Arryn was chasing down Robert’s bastards, but Littlefinger doesn’t say.

Outside, Jaime Lannister and some forces meet Ned and Jory and their men. He’s looking for his brother and tells Jaime he was taken at his command, causing Jaime to draw his sword. There’s a fight, his men get killed, including Jory, which I hate. Jaime wants Ned alive and the two end up squaring off against one another. They’re both good fighters and as the fight goes on, one of Jaime’s men stabs Ned in the leg. Jaime doesn’t like that. He gets on his horse and leaves.

That’s it for this episode. It had quite a bit of action but some moments where you gain a little insight into some of the characters. I really did like the scene with Cersei and Robert. Neither were my favorite characters in the show, but this scene was flawless. 

We also know now that Arryn was tracking down Robert’s bastards, but we’re still not sure why. Still, Ned wants to know who killed Jon Arryn and why, and he’ll pursue it til he finds an answer.

**Now, we’re onto Episode 6, called “A Golden Crown,” where we meet up with some people we didn’t get to see last episode.**

But we open with Robert and Cersei looking down on a convalescing Ned and Cersei goes into attack mode over Tyrion’s imprisonment. Robert tells Ned to get Catelyn to release Tyrion and he is reinstated as Hand. Cersei questions Robert’s strength and he slaps her. Ned wants Jamie to pay for what he did, but he’s fled the city. Robert tells Ned he can’t rule the kingdom if the Starks and Lannisters are at each other’s throats. He also tells Ned he’s more of a brother to him than his actual three brothers. Robert’s going on a hunt and Ned will have to sit on the throne while he’s away. Sounds like fun.

We then see Dany admiring her dragon eggs and she goes and puts one in the brazier and lets it sit a moment before she goes to remove it. Her maid sees her do that and rushes to her and takes the egg out of her hands. Her maid’s hands are burnt but Dany’s are not. Very curious. 

Later, we see Dany in the middle of a ceremony of sorts where she has to eat a horse’s heart, which she does as Drogo looks on proudly. She has to eat all of it and keep it down. The woman performing the ceremony says she will have a boy and he will be the Stallion that Mounts the World. Viserys watches and says her son won’t be a true Targaryen. Dany almost vomits but she hold it in and the people cheer, while she announces her son will be named Rhaego.  Drogo lifts her up and walks her around the platform as the people cheer and Viserys realizes how much these people love her. Him? Not so much. Next thing we know, he’s left the ceremony and Jorah goes after him.

When Jorah finds him, Viserys has taken the 3 dragon eggs from a chest Dany keeps them in. Jorah won’t let him leave with them and he reminds Viserys that he can’t carry weapons there and that he’s to leave the eggs alone. Viserys tells him he’ll never have the love of the people the way Dany got in that tent, and that the dragon eggs will buy him an army. He also intimates that Jorah would like very much to be with his sister in a more than friendly way. Still, he won’t let him leave with those eggs and Viserys finally drops them and goes.

At Winterfell, Bran is sleeping and we see him walking again, following a three eyed raven, which flies down the crypt. He wakes up when Hodor brings him the completed saddle Tyrion had designed for him. Robb and Theon take him riding and Theon wants war because of the attack on Ned and Bran's accident, telling Robb it’s his duty to represent his House now. They lose sight of Bran and Robb goes looking for him. Bran gets attacked by some wildlings who went south of the Wall. There are two men and a woman and they want him to get down from his horse. They cut straps on the saddle to take him off and here comes Robb, who kills one man. The woman hits Robb and he grabs her while the other wildling man grabs Bran. Robb drops the blade but the wildling man gets hit with an arrow from Theon. Theon is ready to kill the woman but she pledges herself to the Stark family. Robb decides to keep her alive.

Oh now we’re back at the Sky Cells, where Tyrion almost rolls right out of them. He’s calling for the turnkey, Mord, who comes in and hits on him with a club. Tyrion tells him his family is rich and he’ll give him lots of gold but when the man sees Tyrion doesn’t have any gold, he leaves. After a while, he calls for Mord again and explains to him his gold was taken when he was captured but the gold is still Tyrion’s. He finally convinces him to tell Lady Arryn that he wants to confess him crimes by flattering him as a smart man and telling him the Lannisters always pay their debts. Seriously, it takes some effort to get through to this man, but he does.

Tyrion is taking to the “throne” room, the one with the big moon door. Tyrion’s confession is not serious though; he’s confessing to everything but the actual crime he’s charged with. Eventually, he asks for trial by combat and wants Jamie to be his champion. They won’t wait for Jaime so he asks if any of the people there would fight for him – Bronn says he will. 

Arya has another dancing lesson, but she doesn’t want to practice. Jory was killed and she’s upset about that and her father getting hurt. Her dancing master tries to get her to put her troubles aside and fight. He also tells her there is only one God – Death – and there’s only one thing we say to it – Not Today. They continue their lessons. Her sister, Sansa, meanwhile, is sewing and insulting her Septa when Joffrey comes in and gives Sansa a necklace and a kiss. I just want to tell her to run.

Back at the hunt, Robert is needling Renly about the women he’s slept with. Renly fights back and is warned off by Robert. Lancel gives him more wine to drink as Selmy looks on. I don't think drinking and hunting area  good mix.

At King’s Landing, Robert hears tales of rape and murder from an older man. They weren’t thieves and from the man’s description, they know it’s the Mountain, Sir Gregor Clegane. Littlefinger says he’s Tywin Lannister’s Mad Dog and it’s clear this attack has to do with Catelyn’s capture of Tyrion Lannister. Ned tells the old man he can’t restore his dead, but he can get him justice. He asks for Lord Beric Dondarrion and tells him to ride with 100 men to Ser Gregor’s Keep and strips him of his land and titles and sentences him to death. He also summons Tywin Lannister to court and if he doesn’t come, he’ll be branded a traitor. 

Ned isn’t playing.

He goes to tell his daughters he’s sending them back to Winterfell. Neither wants to go – Arya because of her sword lessons, and Sansa because she wants to marry Joffrey. He tells them to go pack but something Sansa said leads him to look into that old book he got from Maester Pycelle. It has all the lineages of the Houses and he reads about House Baratheon and how everyone has black hair – except Robert’s children, who have blonde hair. You can almost see the light bulb go off over his head.

Back at the Erye, Bronn goes head to head with a Vale knight who is wearing full armor and carrying a shield. Bronn is not armored and it’s clear he’s just waiting for the man to tire himself out. Once he does, Bronn kills him, and he falls through the moon door. Tyrion and Bronn leave together as Tyrion throws his returned gold to Mord. Little Robin still wants Tyrion to fly through the moon door but that’s not happening.

We return to Vaes Dothrak where the Dothraki are celebrating with a feast, dancing, etc. Viserys shows up and makes a scene so Dany asks Jorah to stop him. He can’t. Viserys says he’s there for the feast and Khal Drogo tells him his place is in the back. When Drogo tells him he is no king, he draws his sword and Dany calls out to him. Jorah warns him to put away the sword before they kill them all, but Viserys says he won’t because they can’t shed blood in their sacred city. While this is true, you kinda wonder if that’s the only way he thought people could get killed, by spilling blood. 

He approaches Dany as one of her maid’s tries to get in between her and her brother, but he turns the sword on her and threatens her with it before she steps back. Then the idiot threatens Dany with it – and her unborn baby. One of the maid’s is translating for Drogo, telling him that Viserys wants his army, what was paid for, or he’ll take Dany back – but he’ll cut out the baby first and leave it for him. Drogo speaks in Dothraki and Dany translates for her brother, saying Drogo says he will have a golden crown that men will tremble to behold. He’s happy with that, saying that’s all he wanted, and Drogo stands and goes to Dany. He puts a hand on her stomach and then tells his men to grab Viserys. Drogo takes off his gold medallion belt and puts it into a pot to melt, which he then dumps over Viserys’ head, killing him. Dany tells Jorah he wasn’t a dragon because fire cannot kill a dragon.

That’s where this episode ends.

As for that last scene, I think most viewers had their attention on Drogo and Viserys, rightfully so.  But as with the first time I watched it, my attention was on Dany and her reaction. She knew what Drogo was going to do and she let it happen, not even turning away from the deed. Granted, her brother was not a nice person and would have made a horrible king, and he treated her badly, but he was her brother and he did try to keep her alive while they were growing up. She shows very little emotion here – none really – and that should raise eyebrows for viewers.

She's most beautiful - Her eyes, her posture, boobs, her booty and most importantly her face. Maybe ScarJo has bigger ass and JesSimpson has a lot bigger boobs but every part of Brie's body is perfectly balanced. Brie in her totally un-sexy Captain Marvel costume is still hotter than Gal Gadot in her over-sexualized Wonder Woman costume.

She doesn't have a shit taste - After breaking up with Ryan Reynolds Scarlett Johansson dates guys that look like typical rapists/pedophiles/gays while Brie is dating real people. Her [new boyfriend](https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/PRI_78184284.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=644%2C783&amp;ssl=1) is really handsome. Also, there's a chance she's bisexual which is cool.

She's very open - She's not afraid of talking about sexism, menstruation and other stuff people don't want to usually talk about.

She want diversity - She wants diversity and she wishes sexism exists, that all, she doesn't wish people were more like hyenas so women can rule men and men would basically be their slaves... that's what I wish for (I'm a man BTW).

She's the sweetest and cutest person ever - Watch the Puppy interview and your heart will melt, watch Jenny Lewis' video with Brie, your heart will melt, watch [this](https://youtu.be/Ct5nXMqJCyA) and... your heart will melt. Even [here](https://youtu.be/RD-Um_qUWcE?t=3) she's cute as hell even though she's just sitting.

She's a great director - Really, the Unicorn store was better than some of the Marvel films.

She's over talented - She can act, she can sing, she can [dance](https://youtu.be/X5uIToJZLZg?t=83), she can survive on the tropical island and she can do [this](https://youtu.be/S2iSpCeowwI)... and it's not gross at all. Also, [how on Earth isn't she in Star Wars movies yet?](https://youtu.be/05pzUXujMJU?t=150)

She is not ashamed of her own body - She didn't removed her social media accounts because of a nude picture only to show her nude body in 2014's Under The Skin like Scarlett Johansson. There are some nude pics of her out there in the internet and guess what? She didn't removed her social medias just because of that like Scarlett did, no because she's not ashamed of her beautiful body.

She deserves her Oscar - Unlike Natalie Portman who used a stunt double in [this scene](https://www.repubblica.it/images/2010/12/23/162232055-4deafd53-139b-48f9-8535-3cefb0842300.jpg) and has an acting skills on a level of a potato. Just watch Kong: Skull Island, The Room, Captain Marvel, Short Term 12... you know what... just watch any movie with Brie and you'll see how good she is in acting. Also and how on Earth doesn't she have star at walk of fame yet?

She loves animals - She's a dog mom and she [loves cats](https://youtu.be/OJ2Vq_PTZLM) (even though she's allergic to them).

Bonus: She's loved by everyone - Literally every human being loves her.
I’m curious to see who you all think has the strongest bond/connection. Each year I feel like there is always one couple who get super close.
*(TRIGGER WARNING \[brief, undetailed mentions of sexual assault, suicide, and self harm, and lots of talk of severe mental disorders, and their symptoms\] and probable explicit language warning lol)* So. This is gonna be a VERYYYYY long one, so please bear with me if you'd like to fully understand, but **tl;dr** After some old trauma months ago with my mother, I've suddenly gotten manic, paranoid, had very erratic thoughts, feelings, and reactions to things and people, and I no longer feel real. I don't feel as if I exist, and I don't feel safe in my own head anymore. My family has a long history of mental illness, so I'm just worried that it's the start of something serious, and I don't know what to do anymore.

Now, short story long. I suppose the best place to start is before the beginning of my problems. So, up until I was about 12 years old, my life was normal, and it was honestly pretty great. Two loving parents that had no marital issues, a stable home and income, always food in front of me, great friends, great siblings (all much older and out of the house, by the way), and I was always happy. Be particularly focused on my mother during this story- she's important. I would go to the movies and go shopping with my mom a couple times a month, and me, her, and my dad would go out for dinners and go on vacations and trips together every summer and every holiday. It was honestly a pretty perfect life. You know, my parents and I butted heads now and then, but hell, what kid doesn't? But when I was about 7, my dad suddenly left one day, and I was given no explanation. He went to live with my grandmother for awhile while he looked for a new place, moved his stuff out, and I mostly lived with my mom, but would see him a couple days through the week, and stay with him every other weekend. Which, I adjusted to pretty well. I still had my occasional anger/crying outbursts from all of the sudden change and confusion, but, yknow, kinda to be expected. But nobody would really explain to me why he'd had to move so suddenly. I remember he would still come over now and them and play cards with my mom like they always used to, while I spectated lol. But I woke up one morning and he was asleep on the sofa, and I asked mom if he was staying for good this time, and she said yes. The weeks passed, he stayed, all was well. I also now realize I have memories of this very same thing happening when I was much much younger, just for the record. But so, over the years, as I got older, I just kinda figured, oh, you know, they had an argument and just wanted a break for awhile. No biggie. It was in the past, it didn't matter. Cut to about April of 2017, we had a family freak incident and both my uncles, entirely unrelated, living in entirely different states, died within hours of each other, both unexpectedly. One of kidney failure from decades of alcoholism (my mom's brother- and literally NOBODY, not a single person, on her side of the family isnt a drinker) and one from a heart attack (dad's brother in law- he was also an alcoholic and so are his sons, but thats unrelated). My mom hadn't spoken to her family is decades. I don't think she'd talked to my uncle in like 30 years. And until we went up there to see her family, she hadn't talked to my grandmother in 25 or 30. Well, for the next few week,s her relationship with my grandmother was great, they'd always call then come to find out one day, my grandmother told y mother she was a worthless excuse of a human being and to never call her again, and hung up. That sent forth a hurricane of a downward spiral on my mother's part. She began getting tattoos almost weekly (she WAS a school teacher at the time, so it was a bit of a problem), would sleep almost all day, never spoke to me or my father, and would leave for work hours early to "walk in the gym" (come to find out, she was having an affair with not one but TWO people at that school), and yadda yadda, long story short she ended up telling me dad she wanted to leave, she moved out, he sued her for divorce so she couldnt kick him onto the streets again, which I get, and I'm thankful for because otherwise, she would've become my sole parent and that would've killed me, and she moved into a trailer exactly 13 minutes down the road from my dad's house (don't ask, I counted once and it's never left my memory lol). I'd see her a couple days a week, and every other weekend. This time, I didn't take the adjustment well AT ALL. My mother, who had been my best friend, was suddenly a woman I didn't even know, and she was constantly manipulating me, yelling, bringing strangers and strange men into the house, and our relationship got very, VERY toxic and unstable. I was 13 at this point. So, the next few months, things just kept getting worse, mom began drinking (she's now a raging alcoholic, and, shocker, refuses to admit it), and \*I\* began very actively self-harming, developed severe anxiety (I've now been professionally diagnosed with severe GAD), major trust issues, and no longer knew what to think of my mother. I still have yet to figure out why it happened, but this one morning, I woke up and my dad was on the phone with who I later learned was my sister. In midst of lots of chatter and jumbled conversations, I heard him mention BPD and Bipolar Disorder. Turns out, my mother is diagnosed with both, among a few less significant things, and I learned that she had been in and out of psych wards, ERs ("suicide" threats. She was deemed to be lying about the urge to kill herself, but still sent to a ward, just for safety reasons, and so they couldnt get sued), and had seen many, MANY psychiatrists and therapists, all before I was born. Dad says she asked him to sit in on a session once, and she went through 3 boxes of tissues, and the shit she had talked about, regarding her childhood and family, was so horrible that he says he doesn't want me knowing about it until I'm older. I have my suspicions that she was molested/raped, and possibly physically abused, as I'm aware that her father was a very abusive, toxic man. I also learned that she's done this exact thing about 5 times before, though it's never progressed this far, or lasted this long. Anyways, she ended up getting with a man (who she ended up marrying in the time I went without speaking to her, more on that later) who has made many sexual remarks and advances on me, and who makes me deeply uncomfortable, and when I voiced this to her once, she screamed at me, and said, "he's a man! Don't dress in those clothes around him, and it won't happen!" (I was in leggings and a cut-off hoodie.) And among lots of other stuff that I'll add later on in the comments if I feel they're necessary, she began openly parading her sex life to me, got BDSM related tattoos displayed on her upper arm (i.e., a bondage bunny mask, and a BDSM symbol), and I also stumbled across some of their bondage before. I've ALSO stumbled across notes that depict absolutely disgusting, explicit acts that my mother evidently wanted to be involved in that she'd leave for him, and they'd literally leave them right where I could find them. I have my suspicions that there was a deeper intention involving me, due to comments made by my mother to some of the men she'd bring in, (i.e., "Isn't she gorgeous?" "Doesn't she have such a cute waistline?" "Aren't her eyes just so pretty??" "She's very *mature* for her age!" and other things.), but I can't be for certain. But after I'd had enough at one point, I told her to take me back home, we got into a screaming match that nearly got the cops called on us by neighbors (I'm about to turn 14 at this point, by the way), and I didn't see her for 13 months after that. The most I spoke to her was the occasional email she'd send, and I rarely replied to them. Then, she came to a dance recital of mine, and i was an idiot, and let her hugging me while we both sobbed in the parking lot make me think she was better and felt sorry. Wrong, but that's unimportant. Anyways, we started seeing each other again, then the BDSM related stuff happened (Im sorry this is so jumbled, but it's a really complicated story), and she began lashing out at me again, and I left again, and haven't seen her since. This was back in August, and honestly, I was fine after it. I've never really stopped self harming, though while I became anorexic for awhile in the midst of this, I'm now healthy in that aspect again. But here is where my point lies: these past few months, seemingly out of nowhere, I've suddenly started behaving similar to her. I'll go from being the happiest happy I've ever been, to wanting to punch whoever speaks to me next, to bawling my eyes out over nothing. I'll have episodes of feelings like my thoughts aren't mine, like consciousness makes no sense, like nothing matters, like I have no purpose and none of us do, so on and so forth. I used to love reading conspiracy theories, but now I can't, because it sends me into those panicked, paranoid episodes. And it's like, I know it's illogical, but I can't stop it. If you have anxiety, you may understand what I mean. Like, when you have a panic attack, and you know your thoughts are illogical, but there's that "what if???" that makes them "logical." I've started self-harming more and more, a=wondering about suicide, and though I don't want to act on those thoughts, at the same time, I just can't help but wonder when everything becomes worth it, and if I'll ever feel normal again. I've been very easily set off, and things that aren't even angering will piss me off to hell's end, and I've become such a total thunderbitch and I can't stand myself sometimes. I've started behaving very manic (i.e., I almost had sex with a boy I had only just met, at a party over the weekend, until I finally snapped out of it, I cut a few inches off my own hair the other night just for fun, which, honestly, it doesn't look bad, so I'm not that upset, just concerned, I've started losing interest in my dance, and school, and I've started losing interest in a boy that I, in sound mind, would give the world to if I could, sole;y because I want to have the freedom to, bluntly, sleep around. I feel like if I go any longer, I'm going to hurt myself or someone else, and I've wondered if maybe a psych ward is a good idea? I don't know. I'm just scared. Last night, I was staring into the pill cabinet, analyzing the contents of all of them for reasons I didn't think about at the time, but now realize was for the sake of if I ever "need" them. I'm just scared of myself, and scared of my thoughts. I don't know what to do. I don't know what's wrong. Frankly, I don;t even know why I posted this, but any responses are accepted and appreciated, as long as they aren't negative. Advice, thoughts ideas, and honestly, just if you have any idea what might be causing all of this. I don't mind. I just really needed to get this all out of my head. If you've read this far, you have the patience of a saint, and thank you very much for your time. &lt;3 Have a wonderful day. And if you're struggling with any sort of mental illness, I wish you the best. I'm sorry if none of this made any sense lol.
There is a contingent of fans that firmly believe Red is Katarina.  The clues cited are in Cape May and Requiem. I personally do not see them until season 4 but to me they lead to contradiction, or are based on faulty logic.

Some of the clues lie in Red being a parent, something in common with daddygate theories, but some are different.

# The fork in the road: Did Kate know?

The first and foremost decision that should be made is that if Rederina is true, 2 different sets of clues point to Kate knowing and not knowing.   Solving this conundrum is necessary and is my biggest indication that is a really good red herring.

**KATE KNOWS**: It is why she speaks of being in Red's employment 30 years and his putting Liz in his arms as a baby, and Red being away when Annie was killed.

**KATE DOES NOT KNOW**: She begs Liz to walk away from Raymond and not repeat the same mistake her mother did by not doing so until it was too late AND calls the woman we met as Naomi Red's wife twice in a room with Dembe, Red and herself AND apologizes to Katarina for digging the bones after doing all she could to destroy Red and send Liz to jail.

&gt;*Please, do what your mother never had the courage to do until it was too late. Walk away from Raymond.*

in this scenario this means: "Please, do what your mother never had the courage to do \[walk away from Raymond Reddington\] until it was too late. Walk away from your mother."

A total nonsense, not a lexical ambiguity.  Not saying walk away from a bad situation, not as your mother did, but using the example of Katarina who started to pull away from the affair with Raymond, but he was in too deep and Raymond took Liz as a result.

Kate also tells Red he has to let Liz go,  after faking Liz's death.  She never once acts as if she believes Red has a right to be in Liz's life.  Tell the man in the woods he loves Liz, not that he is a parent.

**CONCLUSION =&gt;** I can see an explanation of the 20 vs. 30 years in the abnormalities of Kate's resume and Red's penchant for anonymously hiring  minders, which leads to Kate belief in 2017 that Red had hired her to keep an eye on Katarina and Liz, but I could not find any contortion-free (CF) way that would have Kate tell Liz to walk away from her mother turned her father and not as her mother did, walk away from her father until it was too late.

Add that she calls Naomi Red's wife, and her emotional apology when she digs the bones, and it seems that this cannot be.  IF Red is Katarina, Kate did not know.

So, any hopes of seeing this through have to come from Kate not knowing Red is Katarina, and thus we **HAVE to discard any clues pointing to Kate knowing**, such as the 30 years, the placing Liz as a baby in her care, and being away when Annie was killed. Eliminate the impossible and see what is left.

So, let me take the clues, one by one and see if I can explain them by any other means:

# IN PRO OF REDERINA

**CLUE: denying he is her father but accepting Liz is his daughter.**

this seems a take on the gender bias riddle:

&gt;A father and son get in a car crash and are rushed to the hospital. The father dies. The boy is taken to the operating room and the surgeon says, “I can’t operate on this boy, because he’s my son.”

But there are clues directly against this being the case:

Red also speaks to Liz's father being a career criminal who abandoned her: *Abandoned by a father who was a career criminal,* and the second time  Liz asks in 1.22, Red does not answer, he declines on the basis of having killed Sam to prevent him from telling Liz information about her father: *I loved Sam, Lizzy. Taking his life was of all the difficult things that I've done that may may be the most. But I did it to keep you from learning the name of your real father, to protect you. And you must understand-- having done that, I'm certainly not going to tell you who he was now.*

When Red killed Sam he told him: *You will always be her father, Sam. I can only hope to love her and protect her as you would have.*  If Red is Katarina, this is fundamentally wrong.   Because RR was Liz father, Red cannot pretend to take the role of father, because he is her mother.  This phrase makes sense if Red is RR, and Liz's father, and he tells the man who raised his daughter that he cannot take that away from him.   So, in 1.10 when Red tells Liz he is not her father after a very long pause, he had killed Sam less than a month before.  This solemn promise cannot be broken by telling her he is her father.  BUT he can say she is his daughter.

Moreover,  This is exactly what he answers with Kirk, and the way he phrases his suggestion that she can be his girlfriend from Ann Arbor, so that he can say she can be his daughter, not that he can be his father.

**CONCLUSION =&gt;**  INCONCLUSIVE  It could be a physchological reason or a take on the gender bias riddle.

&amp;#x200B;

**CLUE: Red said Liz's father is dead.**

Yes, Red did say that in 1.22:  *Lizzy, look at me. I'm telling you, with no uncertainty, your father is dead. He died in that fire.*

But he did tell her so after telling her that her father abandoned her, which contradicts RR took Masha because he wanted to be in her life and was killed. Red then told Liz that her memory of leaving her father to die in a burning house was not true:  *Lizzy, the memories of a four-year-old are unreliable.*

Red also called Liz's memories of killing her father an example of Krilov manipulating memories:  \[Krilov, \] *One of the few people who have mastered the science of memory manipulation.*  And his example of manipulating memories? *The memory of an accident, a tragedy, a fire in which a 4-year-old girl killed her father.*

Red hired Krilov to protect Liz from the "memory" of killing her father.  All that is needed is that Liz believed she had done so because she never saw him again, because he had a burned, unrecognizable face, or because she was a traumatized child.

There is another time he SEEMS to be saying Liz killed RR, when Liz asks him how did her mother gave her up: *The man she loved killed by the child she adored.*

This is a very curious piece of information.   But besides what else it may be, it is the answer to how could Liz mother give her up.

Is this the truth (that Katarina believed RR to be dead or knew to be the truth), or what Red believed at the time was her reason, or simply what Red imagined, is a different issue.  It corresponds to Cape May's suicide speech, and to Rassvet's repeated suicide attempts, but does not go with Red's descriptions of Katarina as *the cleverest, most resourceful woman I have ever known,*  Moreover, Dembe, Red and Peter say Liz reminded them of her mother when she is anything but determined and assertive.

What Red is telling Liz is that Liz's mother thought her father was dead and was never the same.  Katarina gave her daughter up at a very dark time where she had little hope (Like Liz did).  Later on, Red will explore that Katarina did so because she was dangerous for Liz and saw no way forward, which is what Red tells Liz in season 6: *If she were here, I'm sure she'd tell you she made so many mistakes. She was scared and uncertain and just trying to do the best she could.* This also corresponds to Liz's reasons for placing Agnes with her grandmother.

On a similar case, he told Liz her mother was dead, committed suicide in 1990, but that does not seem to be the literal case.  If anything there is a case for a figurative death as parents.

**CONCLUSION =**\&gt; AMBIGUOUS AT BEST.

&amp;#x200B;

**CLUE: Both Katarina and Red seem to have had a mother with Russian origins.**

Yes.  The story presented by Katarina's mother to her husband of being from St. Petersburg speaks of her not being able to pass for any other nationality but Russian.  In the end of the Cold War taking a name that was Russian was a sure invitation to be scrutinized.

And yes, the choice of meals Red had speaks of her mother having Russian origins.

But do that mean they are the same person?

**CONCLUSION =&gt;**  INCONCLUSIVE

&amp;#x200B;

**CLUE: Red and Katarina seem to have similar traits: controlling, smart, capable of violent acts.**

Yes.  Also common traits of covert agents, counterintelligence officers, and criminals.  A great description is provided by Red when admits he shares traits with Tom:

&gt;*recruits wayward children, orphans, delinquents, outcasts, but only boys and girls of s****uperior intelligence*** *who exhibit very* ***specific sociopathic tendencies.*** *He then cultivates them into* ***charming, well-educated, cultured, attractive*** *adults who are* ***capable of dangerous*** *and horrible things.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Unfortunately, Tom and I* ***share some propensities***\*. Whatever you think you know about Tom Keen, forget it. The bookish elementary-school teacher was a masterful illusion. The man is an extremely talented covert operative. I'm not surprised he convinced you that his persona was real. Once he takes on a new identity, he convinces himself.\*

So, it is not usual to be attracted to people similar to oneself.  One tends to meet more people with those traits in that world.  What we know of RR was not a shy desk bound guy: Beirut, Kuwait, meeting Sarantos while he was running illegal weapons, being a rising star in counterintelligence.

Tom and Liz shared traits, but they were not the same.  Tom and Gina shared traits as well.

**CONCLUSION =&gt;** INCONCLUSIVE.

&amp;#x200B;

**CLUE: Red knew about the dancing and the whisper to Kirk.**

That is explained by many  other ways in addition to Red being Katarina: Someone told Red, she had done the same to Red, it was a common seduction routine, Red had arranged it, Red had seen it, etc.

**CONCLUSION =&gt;** INCONCLUSIVE

&amp;#x200B;

**CLUE: Red tells Jennifer he was being hunted by the same people who were hunting Katarina.**

&gt;RED: *In 1990, the KGB and the CIA had almost nothing in common except the mutual determination to hunt down one individual.*  
&gt;  
&gt;JENNIFER: *You.*  
&gt;  
&gt;RED: *Being a fugitive from American law enforcement is a lot easier than being a fugitive from the two most powerful nations on Earth*

Note that Red does NOT confirm he is talking about him.  He is taking the thread from before, when Jennifer asks him how he is able to close a restaurant in daylight: *How does this happen? How do you close a restaurant down in the middle of the day? How can you be so calm when you're on the FBI's Most Wanted List?*

Jennifer had started asking why were she and her mother abandoned. Red told her that he had been framed because he tried to destroy the cabal, but Jennifer feels his is an evasion, not an honest answer. This is the context in which he tells her that, while being a fugitive from the FBI is not that hard, he can close a restaurant in daylight, and walk around, being a fugitive of the CIA and the KGB is a different story.   BUT that was Katarina, chased by both.  RR would tracked by the FBI, and he was a natural enemy of the KGB.   So, YES, Red IS talking about Katarina.

The reason Jennifer was "abandoned" by her father was that *In 1990, the KGB and the CIA had almost nothing in common except the mutual determination to hunt down one individual.*  That is Katarina, *a traitor to two countries, both global superpowers.  So, what Red is telling Jennifer is that the reason her father abandoned her was because Katarina Rostova was being hunted by the CIA and the KGB.*

But if Red is Katarina, RR is dead, he did not abandon his wife and daughter, he died in the fire after Liz shot him.  Katarina took his identity because she was being hunted by the CIA and the KGB.  She was not abandoned, she was an orphan, and the person in front of her set her father up as a traitor, took his identity and continued to debase it, and is responsible for everything that happened to her.  Moreover, Jennifer is a walking proof that she is not RR.

YET there is another explanation: Carlarina.  The reason Red had to "abandon" his family is that the method for hiding Katarina rested on her being scared of her husband in her Carla Reddington identity.  Under the eye of WITSEC, she was protected, but to guard the charade, she had to pretend to be scared of her husband, and he had to pretend to be uninterested and a threat.  Alone and scared, that was the best she could do: leave Liz with Sam and hide as a scared wife who gave the US Justice Department proof against her traitor husband.

**CONCLUSION =&gt;** INCONCLUSIVE

# THE CLUES FROM CAPE MAY

the most ambiguous of all episodes,  Cape May undoubtedly is an opium fueled hallucinatory ghost story.  The only real people in the beach and the house are the sherif and the treasure hunter. Everything else is imagined, remembered, or hallucinated by Red.   Red speaks all the lines.  The episode was written and filmed after The Artax Network, so the cab and the locket connect the two of them. Red may be suicidal: he pays his debts and suspends transactions.  He feels there is nothing left for him. He goes to a place that was deeply traumatic for him.  He hallucinates with Katarina, but does not recognize her as such until AFTER he had said his suicide speech.

**The Hobson choice:**   Red is talking about herself and Liz, she chose to save Liz and it was the worst thing she had to do.  But what exactly is this choice? in Rederina, Katarina supposedly had been stealing information from RR.  RR took Liz, and Katarina told Fitch RR had the fulcrum and Liz and she could discredit him instead of killing him. She set him to be a traitor,  went to get Liz back,  a fire ensued,  she fought with RR, Liz killed him, she and Ilya tried to save him but he died, and she dropped Liz with Kate, and disappeared.  RR's wife and child were placed in PC and then in WITSEC, and  after 3 months she staged the fake death, and then 6 months later, she takes the identity of her dead lover, to continue to become the criminal she had set him to be, further damaging his reputation.  So, the choice here is not between her former female self and Liz, is between her dead lover's reputation and Liz.

Was the choice RR's?  But by taking Liz he was not saving Liz.  He supposedly took her because Katarina would not let him see the child.  Katarina was perfectly capable of protecting herself.  And why even call Fitch?  Why not recover the fulcrum and keep quiet.  It is she who tells Fitch RR had the fulcrum with a death switch.  It makes no sense.

CONCLUSION =&gt; it does no work.

&amp;#x200B;

**CLUE: Red saying in Cape May he was a different person, and adding you as he was Katarina before.**

The line in the CC is:

&gt;HALLUCINATION: *You've been here before.*  
&gt;  
&gt;RED: *Once, a long time ago. I was a very different person then. You?*

becomes: Once, a long time ago. I was a very different person then, you.

I hear the rising intonation in the "you" indicative of a question.  It is a regular speech construction in which "How about you?" becomes "You?"

CONCLUSION =&gt; INCONCLUSIVE.

The woman he loved is about Liz and Agnes.

**CLUE: the visuals at Cape May &amp; Rassvet: getting out of the water, and fighting some baddies.**

They had already filmed the episodes.  It is cheaper and easier to use the same.  And if it creates ambiguities is even better.  BUT if they had re-filmed the scenes in which Red was killing people as Katarina killing them: the stairway guillotine, the closet fire, THEN it would have been far better at been any proof.  As it stands what do we have:

She goes in the water,  gets out on her own, goes in the house, fights the baddies, goes back in the water, gets out of the water again in the same exact manner and this time walks to a church where she collapses, then tries to jump off a roof?  WTF?  A determined woman who sees no way forward fails to kill herself 3 times?

because in reality, Rassvet and Cape May cannot coexist. they make no sense together.

**CONCLUSION =&gt;** makes no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

# THE CLUE FROM RASSVET

https://preview.redd.it/rx9ges70iby31.png?width=442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62d6d0f6e795352a4366915f3c50af74cfac32e8

But it makes sense Katarina would change her face.   Koehler was an expert in changing faces.  We saw him altering the Corsican's face.  He changed the face of Basil Vladakis.  That does not mean he did not do something else, but it does not prove he did either.

&amp;#x200B;

The proofs are not conclusive either way.  Leaves the question open.   In Part 2 I explore the clues against to see if any is conclusive.

Edited for omission.
Yurrr wass good everyone! I see y’all liked my One Piece x Berleezy video I made a while back 😁 Last night, I was introduced to a litty JoJo song and it literally went in sync with some of Berlins’ dances lmaoo so I got inspired to make a video on it. I’ve got most of it done last night so the video should be up before the weekend! Stay tuned y’all, I know y’all will definitely love this EUUUUUUUGHHHHHHH 🐋💨
Back on the dating scene after nearly 20 years - split up with my wife last year, worked on myself, blah blah blah now I'm back at a point where I'm actively looking for someone to share the wonderfulness of my life. Getting out there, meeting people, flirting for the fun of it, living my life. All that stuff.

Thing is, it's reminded me how I was always, always hopeless at making the definitive, out on a limb, no denying I just put it out there, move. Pre marriage, basically I got a bit drunk, but I'd rather not do that any more. It's not like I'm particularly unconfident, socially, or bad at reading people. I have to do a lot of both for work, and I make new friends and acquaintances really easily. I'm basically a pretty sociable animal, and rationally, I know I'm averagely attractive for my age physically, make people laugh, notice and build on the little looks and 'accidental' touches... but then I have no idea when, how, or whether an actual 'move' will be welcomed. How do other people do it?

Here's an example. Last weekend, I was at a gig with a bunch of Meetup people. Half a dozen of us, all of us met before, and get on well, and without question, I'm hitting it off with one of the women, and I fancy her too. Looks, laughing and shared jokes, odd 'casual' touches, that sense of complicity building. As the band was playing, everybody's dancing and we somehow keep ending up close, and for a few songs, she's in front of me, both of us facing the band and moving kind of together, bodies brushing together, and my hands on her hips now and then.

At which point I should've pulled her closer and escalated a bit, I know. But I wasn't quite sure enough. I mean she wasn't moving away, but she wasn't particularly pushing back against me or anything. So I just kind of kept it at that, and then after the band finished, we all go onto another bar, talking in a group again. Kind of ambiguous and inconclusive.

So how do I get my head round this kind of situation and make the definitive, clear move?
Aslamoaleikum,

Background: I am well settled in a western country having a good stable position and income Alhamdullilah. I try my best to follow and improve on my deen everyday. When it came to marriage, I needed a women who brings me closer to ALLAH and helps me improve further on my deen. Apart from being educated, I didn't had any major ask from the girl. All my family and would be (Aisha) lives back home. 

My sister-in law still l(not so religious) introduced me to her cousin Aisha as she is steadfast in deen and she thought it would be a good match. First we chatted a bit on the phone then families got involved, and now its almost the time for Nikah. 

Issue: In all my conversations with Aisha, she agrees with my viewpoints regarding following Sunnah and Shariah in our daily life and so we decided to go ahead.   Since the talk about marriage started, I am facing a lot of resistance from my and their family as I want just a simple Nikah (in mosque) as per Shariah and they wan't the generic one which is common in our society these days ( grand functions in hotel, full bridal makeup, girl and boy sitting liking showpiece on the stage, all those stupid customs and games(brought over from bollywood movies), videos and photos , bit of song and dance etc etc. ) .Alina was on my side during all these discussion and I was proud of that. I have had  major arguments with my family during the marriage planning phase, but I was steadfast in my ask and I always told them that its our marriage and both of us wants to do things as per shariah and sunnah so who are they to obstruct it ? 

Heartbreak : Yesterday I came to know from my sister in law that Aisha also wants the same generic societal wedding as its "every girl's dream" and all these frills is common for every girl. What I am asking for (the shariah way of marriage) is my extreme interpretation of Islam and what Aisha thought (about shariah) is the modern interpretation of Islam. (As my sister in law is close to Aisha, I know she will be telling the truth). 

Sisters in Islam, is this not hypocrisy or a lie ? that at one end you follow Salah and fasting and witr and tahajjud but on the other end you want to do a full bridal makeup and sit in front of 500 people with photos and videos being taken by strangers. And you think all those bollywood style games and functions are just normal and bit of songs and dance doesn't harm anyone as its normal and every girl's dream. ? Where do we draw this line ? Tomorrow She might as well say Hijab is not necessary and this may go on and on in every aspect of life. I feel cheated a bit. 

Note: Kindly be respectful of Aisha (name changed), please don't any harsh words against her as its only ALLAH who knows the truth in her heart. So please be gentle in your suggestions.
Title kinda explains l, but yeah, context, I asked my crush out like 2 or 3 weeks ago and yeah we had a date and it went well. Tho she said that she "sees me as a friend" and "it would be weird for us to date cuz we've been friends for quite a long time(6 years)" and today at our usual dance class when I said a sarcastic joke under my breath, she responded behind me with my name but like in a cute way, dunno how it's in English, translator says" nickname", but I don't think it's like that... Well I feel like im getting mixed signals, cuz she said I'm a cool guy and all, but it would just be weird.. I'm happy cuz usually only my mom calls me like that time to time when I'm being a good son and no one else has called me like that... Really feels special, and she doesn't talk to other boys that much as she does with me. I dunno what to think, I like her, hell I love her but like, I don't want to annoy her by asking her about that... I'm already blessed that I didn't ruin our friendship by asking her out in the first place... Help
Obligatory “I’m on ps4 and play with 6-7 sensitivity.” 

Ever since shadowkeep dropped ive been noticing way more inconsistency in my precision and aggressive frame shotgun blasts. Too often an enemy will get hit, live, and melee me for my trouble. Sometimes the pellets will flat out disappear. Even in what we’re told is the ideal range (8-9m) the ohko distance doesn’t seem to work as before. I attribute this to connection issues brought on by SBMM, though truthfully a Bungie shadow-nerf could be just as responsible. But what is the solution? Well for my kinetic slot I dug out an old friend: My Chaperone. Much higher range and consistency and even a body shot can be quickly followed up with another slug or melee hit. Really good for dealing with pesky recluse users (unless they take you by surprise). The Panama Ravine ornament has a longer barrel which actually seems to give a half meter more range. 
And for my energy slot? I went old school. An outlaw/kill clip The Last Dance sidearm. 3-round burst. Awesome body shot ttk (making it very forgiving). Easier to aim than smg’s. More range than most shotty’s. But forces you to be closer up than scout users and most pulse users would like you to be. Great in air accuracy. I had an Icarus mod on mine before, but I’ve since switched to backup mag to allow for easier follow up engagements. Last Hope ruled Destiny 2 year one. With it having random rolls, and the new Shadowkeep sandbox changes, it’s cousin The Last Dance makes for a worthy successor.

Edit:spelling and grammar.

So I think that my crush likes me back. We have known each other since 7th grade but never really talked untill last year, we became pretty good friends quickly and she randomly just started sitting with my friend group (always across from or next to me), and a few weeks ago I was told by a friend of both of us that she only sat with us to talk to me. She does have other friends (some that are guys) but she still really only sits with me, and she has friends that shes known for years (I see her sometimes hanging out with them in the hallways and around town) which just baffles me. We usually just talk about games, memes, and other bits of our lives. We sometimes tease each other and what not and always smile at each other. Recently, I had asked her if she wanted to see a movie with me and she said yes and we had a great time (everyone but my wallet, tickets were 13 bucks each) and afterwards she asked if I was hungry and then bought me some ice cream. Then last weekend she had asked if I wanted to go get lunch with her and she asked if we could meet further from the restaurant so we could walk together, afterwards she had followed me back to the place, passing her street to keep talking with me. However, on Tuesday a friend had asked her if she had a crush on anyone and she had said no, I wasnt there (I was sick for a while) but the friend had told me about it and then I lookd back and couldnt tell if she had just wanted to be friends or if she did have a crush on me. I'm probably just overthinking but I would like some more input

Also, about a month ago we had done volunteer work together the same day of a school dance and I had asked if she wanted to go the dance and she had said yes, but then a friend had shown up at the place we were volunteering. We all went to the dance and then got ice cream. Just thought this might beimportant.
After the urge of several people from this subreddit to play the DLC of DS1, I gave in and dove into the past. Boy am I glad I did. The DLC is just a collection of enjoyable boss battles.

I know a lot of people love Artorias (I do too), but in my opinion Magnus was the highlight of the DLC. Super aggressive, super strong , super unfair, his relentless attacks give no room for breathing nor healing.

I took about 4 hours to beat the guy, but a big chunk of that time was wasted with me just diving into the abyss and doing my best to manhandle magnus.

Eventually I grew tired of losing so I checked up some tips online--and the best tip I found was to understand his forearm movements. And then I spent the next hour and a half deconstructing his moveset.

It was at that point that I was sure of what I felt--I was thoroughly enjoying the game. Just one more... That was what I was continuously telling myself. One more and I'll perfect it... And perfect it I did. The last round between me and magnus was a dance--I was totally in the zone and I knew I had it in the bag.

All in all I enjoyed the process of learning. This is why I love dark souls so much. It doesn't try to be too realistic - - it knows it is a game, and it puts you in the position of learning how to beat the game methodically.

I love this game so much.


This may not be the right sub for this but it's the best I could find

I don't remember much about the show expect for a single part of it which includes what I remember to be a 3d animated purple cat dancing on stage with lights flashing behind 

I can't remember what the entire show was about but I remember that it would cut to the cat near the end of the show 

I last saw the show in 2004-2005

And I've been trying to remember it since 2015.

So any help is appreciated
 

**Introduction:**

Elric is an Elven Bladesinger Wizard, he spent a century studying both magic and sword technique at the Eilpine Grandarius (Elven magic college). During his time there he fought with another student as a result he lost his arms due to the damage, with the help of some others he researched and build prosthetic arms (started as a joke about FMAB). this occurs in a mid magic setting.

**Physical appearance / Gear:**

Elric is a 178 year old Male High Elf, he stands at 183cm (6'0) with a Rhomboid build (shoulders slightly wider than hips). He has Icy blue eyes, fairly pale skin, and a short parted hairstyle. his face is littered with small faded scars with 3 prominent ones: the first going from the middle of the forehead to the right of the jaw going over the eye, further to the right only going across his eyebrow to the middle of his cheek, finally from the middle of his left cheek across to the middle of his chin. he is missing his arms but has prosthetics. 

He wears a dark brown Sheepskin Trench Coat with matching colour trousers, a dark blue tunic underneath. he carries a Sultan's scimitar in his right hand and has blue flames which emit a cold mist in his left. laying around the back of his neck lays a black and white cat as his familiar, with blue eyes like his.

**Personality:**

Growing up high in the mountains Elric is used to the cold and his skin and attitude reflect this. He carries himself with confidence and grace, though he carries a somber air about him. He is willing to do anything if it means that he can do good or get closer to finding his captured lover, Arya, who was captured by Orcs. He thinks before he acts and prefers to have a plan and abandon it then to rush in without thought, regardless of the plan he won't stop until he accomplishes his goals. Due to his cloistered background he carries an untrustworthy demeanor in his speech.

**Background:**

*You see I'm a man who is slow to anger, but when you take something that I love from me; you're playing a dangerous game. I like to help others where I can, no matter the cost. but I'll go the some extreme lengths to protect the people who are important to me. now imagine how far I'll go to recover the one who saved my soul, and who I failed to protect. on to less grim sentiments, my particular affinity for cold magic lends me to helping my allies but impairing our enemies while I dance while my blade sings. However I do find myself lacking when it comes to arcane matters concerning fire, things tend to be... unpredictable.*

Hey all, recently I read some tweets talking about Kazakhs in Mongolia, what's happening there? About learning Mongolian in school?

How Kazakh-nationalist are Kazakhs in Mongolia in general may I ask?

Like in Xinjiang, China, Kazakhs are very nationalists, constantly bragging about Kazakhstan and Kazakh history, and usually have very wrong historic facts, like they always say stupid shits like:

"Chinggis Khan is Kazakh", "Chinggis Khan spoke Kazakh at home with his mother", "Back then people in Mongol Empire were all Kazakhs", "Northern Xinjiang and Western Mongolia belong to Kazakhstan from thousand years ago", "Kazakhs are Mongolian's grandfather", "All Mongolian dances originated from Kazakhs" and other shits.

But you know Kazakhs only formed their ethnic identity after Kazakh Khanate, which is few hundred years later than Mongol Empire. And the Turkic-tribes back then cannot be equate to modern Kazakhs, like Kyrgyzs, Tuva, Altai and Oirat people all have ancient Turkic blood. But you know the most of them never read actual historic papers or books, they only believe the fake stuff they read in some Kazakh forums (usually in Chinese social media).

Thus Mongolians in Xinjiang usually have bad relationships with Kazakhs, especially online, you see them always fighting over something. Also Uyghurs and Kazakhs do not get along sometimes as well, so do Kyrgyz and Kazakhs.

So how do people in Mongolia get along with Kazakhs? I heard many of them cannot speak Mongolian even, and some of them cannot speak Kazakh. According to Mongolian Immigration Agency's recent data, there are almost 800 Kazakhs gave up their Mongolian citizenship and migrated to Kazakhstan in past 3 years, well, good for them!


Hi folks,

I'm a choral music nerd and love how vocal music interweaves with identity and culture, and I'm interested in putting together the module described above to teach my third years (14-15 yrs old). I've a fairly flexible curriculum to teach how and what I want, and am encouraged to try anything I like. I'm thinking everything from slave songs in the American South, to civil rights protest song, Vietnam era folk song, Apartheid era south African choral music, gumboot dancing, U2's Sunday Bloody Sunday, even up to Where is the Love by the Black Eyed Peas (but would welcome lots of specific examples of songs and other "genres" of protest music, so to speak). This would work well with what they're learning in history too for some cross curricular learning, and I can probably dig out enough concepts from the musical example to satisfy the curriculum being taught.

I'd like to pair this with some kind of project or presentation or...something that they research and work on themselves to supplement their learning.  I'm a bit clueless as to what form this could take apart from some kind of PowerPoint that they present themselves, and would appreciate your input here.

Has anyone done anything like this? I don't want to reinvent the wheel if possible, so if anyone has any insights from doing something similar I'd love to hear from you.

Cheers,

WP.



I often leave the gym feeling like I should've gone harder. I am comfortable in drilling with increased resistance, but when it comes to live rolling I feel as though I am too gentle, almost just dancing with my sparring partner rather than rolling.  On the flip side as I've been working on breaking down postures I've been whipping dudes around from guard looking like I'm whiplashing them. Should I concentrate on being more aggressive? Is this part of the game? Am I mistaking patience for passiveness?  Any and all honest feed back will help, and thank you. 38(m) white belt 4months in.







Dance says “non-aura enchantments”...can you target the Theros block constellation creatures like Doomwake and Eidolon?
At the beginning of this school year i fucked up and got caught smoking weed on a school trip. The school then gave me a choice to either visit rehab sessions or get kicked out. Ofc i took the rehab.
The "therapist" then also connected with my parents.
At home i was given strict rules which were basically to be grounded for a year, provided i keep my grades up and work at home. They also took all my money away ( i had worked all summer)
I stuck by the rules for a good month not doing anything but what they told me. This is where a school dance comes into play. Because i failed my previous grade my ex-classmates (after a long time) convinced me to join them on their prom. Im supposed to be dancing with a good girl friend.
I first told my mom that im doing this and will have to attend weekly dance lessons. I remember her saying it was ok (she refuses to acknowledge that) but that she'll check about any info about my co-dancer.
A few days roll by, its weekend and i guess they come to a conclusion that it wasnt ok for me to attend. I already made promises to that girl.
They repeatedly told me to drop it but i still went because i felt guilty about dropping her and honestly all my friends are in that ex class so thats almost the only time i see them.
I come home and we have a huge fight, after the girl says that her dad will cover the cost  of dance lassons for me... So now im even deeper into this.
I think i should also mention im 18 and im really getting fed up with being controlled like this altho i undersand its because of my own fuck up.

So the question is .. how do i get my parents to let me go to the dance without triggering an all out war in my family. Also keep in mind my parents have contact with my rehab which also focuses on my relationships and basically my whole life.

What are some  sleep deprivation hallucinationsThat one can have
Okay, so this is something I've been thinking about for a while now. Something that never made sense to me. In the time leading up to Help Wanted, we had been shown the image of many different animatronics fused (or melted) together. It was a piece of imagery that never really fit into the actual game other than it being a bunch of different games in one. Then, I remembered the end of Fnaf 6. In it, the animatronics all go down in a supposedly final blaze of glory, freeing the souls, and ending this chapter. But, what if it didn't?

If you recall, William Afton discovered a kind of 'Soul Matter' called 'Remnant', which allowed him to fuse childrens' souls and inject them into animatronics, like in Candy Cadet's stories. They all involved taking different things and making them one, then putting them into some container. Well, what I'm thinking is that, since he had to melt the remnant to inject it, that means it must be able to stand extreme temperatures. Which brings us to the end of Fnaf 6. They all burn, heating them up to an extreme degree. But, what if all this did was melt the animatronics' souls together? Henry probably wouldn't know anything about remnant, so, if it was him that burned down the pizarrea, then he could have accidentally made all the animatronics one being! 

Think about Glitchtrap. He's a virus uploaded into Help Wanted, possibly through a mess of parts delivered to the game dev's door, and wishes to take control of your mind. But, in the Pizza Party ending, he lures you into the back room in a Golden Bonnie suit, brings you on stage, and puts you into an animatronic. But, why? What could he have to gain from that? Well, what it wasn't Afton, but, instead, it was ALL of the animatronics' souls fused, made into a program, and is now showing you the last thing the originals saw before their Doom? What if they want you to switch places with them, for you to be the one on stage, and for them to be free, dancing? What if the parts that the game devs found were actually the parts that had melted together, including the remnant? My theory is that the children have concocted a plan to take control of your mind through VR. They did it to Tape Girl, who has tricked you into putting him into a plushie, so he could remain safe, while she enacted the plan in a *white rabbit* suit. Anyone else notice how Tape Girl sounds a lot like Reluctant Follower? And, think about it. She doesn't sound all that reluctant. But, what if she had been taken control of by Glitchtrap, and this wasn't actually what she wanted to do? A little off topic, but a nice thought.

Dreadbear is a confusing character. They named a dlc after him, but he does almost nothing! Well, what is Dreadbear, or Frankenstein's Monster, for that matter? They are a bunch of different parts put together into one container. Like the remnant, like Candy Cadet's stories, and like the teaser for the original game. The Parts and Service minigame is symbolic of William's experiments with remnant, his attempts to bring life to an empty vessel, through INJECTING FLUIDS into a brain and putting into Dreadbear. Then, what about Glitchtrap's grave? Well, Im not as sure about it, because it's really hard to tell, but I could see animatronics flashing in his grave. Then, looming over it all, is Dreadbear.

Besides. Golden Freddy had William Afton, and wasn't letting go. He's in Hell, not a Glitchsuit.

Now, I'm not entirely sure on this one. I've put a lot of thought into this though, and I'd be greatful for any feedback. This is my first time coming out with a theory, so I'll be glad to hear what you have to say!


I've had everything working for a while now, but recently, the red light next to the cartridge slot has stopped flashing and every game, plugin, and other software I had installed on my SD card is no longer accessible, giving me a message stating "The file is corrupt" without any additional error messages or codes to refer to.

I've removed the card and rebooted the device to find that all of the apps are still present on the live area screen, but upon opening, stating the file is corrupt. After putting the SD card I had back in, I opened up Vitashell to find that the SD card is not being read or detected by the device.

I have firmware 3.65 running on a PCH-1100 with a Funturbo SD2Vita 5.0 adapter and a 128 GB micro SD card, alongside a 4 GB official sony memory card.

The official memory card was set up not to hold games, which is most likely the case seeing as I had well over 80 gb of games on the device before running into this issue.

This occurred after trying to do a fresh reinstall of Persona 5 Dancing in Starlight.

I've tried looking this issue up on this reddit, but I haven't had any luck finding any clear answers.
I've been wanting to make a doom foretold deck (but dont want to play Teferi) and I've been wanting to make an Outlaw's Merriment deck (but dont want to play fires). 

they kinda fill the same slot, I dunno. 4 mana power build arounds. 

Mainly I'm looking for deck ideas that include Doom Foretold and/or Outlaw's Merriment because I think these cards are interesting. I might make the Esper control deck running around anyway, it just seems dull. I have the deck picked out for an Orzhov Control deck built around Doom Foretold and Ethereal Absolution, but it does seem to be missing that power card at 3 that Teferi fills in the Esper version, and it doesnt have the win con that Dance of the Manse is.

what are some other control decks that are built around Doom Foretold and/or Outlaw's Merriment?
Just wanted to let this band know,   if your not busy then listen up!  I have been  for singing
for 8 years +.  I discovered your music through a depressing part of my life, I am the type who plays, dances  to or sings 24/7. Not only did your music save my life and keel me moving, I listen and know all the songs of all the albums,  and I listen to them cause your voice is the highlight of my day( not to sound weird).  From a fellow Cancer,  and to the rest of the band,  I love you guys!  My name is Rose and I want you guys to keep it up!
Spike, stop dancing around it and just say that the difference in the way Embiid's conditioning is treated versus Jokic's conditioning is RACISM.  If you're gonna have a take, have the take, coward.
* **Frustration** i got from few planned dates that eventualy were canceled. But another are to come!

* **Angriness** i get from hormones or other situations that i dont have influence at. 

* **Horniess** about women that are tightening up so much to me while dancing.

All this screams to me to use some pixel stimulus or now rather more interesting for me now is(woud be) to use some girl for sex, but i keep going strong and resist from that, i only get numbers and want to date and get to know a girl, even tho it happened that girl wanted to go with me for casual sex - i didnt go for that. Staying in this state motivates me and keeps me in this agression mode with watning to look for women, meet them and geting to know. And being flirty with them. Looking strongly and very long in the eyes with no effort.
I’d seen Irreversible and Enter The Void but didn’t really fancy Climax until they discussed it.

It’s... a Gaspar Noe film. One of his best for sure. I love Irreversible and didn’t like Enter The Void. Climax was closer to the former. Some really incredible filmmaking and performances. 

I think it became a bit less interesting late on when it went full nightmare and random side characters just started becoming inexplicably violent. But I’ve also never OD’d on LSD in a dance club before so who knows. The long take of Sofia Boutella falling apart as she walked slowly through the building was amazing. 

Anyone else check it out?
Hi all  
Looking for some dares for a r18 games night and thought id get some ideas from you guys  
Looking for a 1-5 scale so would be great if you could comment with an idea for each

1. is super innocent (eg sing a song, do a dance, etc)
2. will be involving other people but still somewhat clean (Kiss x, grab y's tits / crotch over clothes)  
This will also be where clothes start coming off
3. Getting more sexual but keeping in mind there still may be layers of clothes  
eg ( Hand down pants / up shirt for 10 seconds)
4. Hopefully by now everyone will be naked so more sexual related  
(oral sex, eat food of x's privates, etc)
5. at this point we may as well just give up on the games and call it a sex party  
(penetration, go to different rooms for 2 mins) etc

I dont see us getting much past 4 as i expect the night to just dissolve at that point, but would be good to have a bit of variety to help out

Note: Not all dares need to be sexual in nature, eg it could be a "Go to the end of the drive" but if its in level 3 chances are the person is in underwear  
or do jumping jacks, but level 4 so their bits flop about

Looking forward to your input

what do you think about physical exercise this including like: running, practicing any sport, or like dancing, applied to our biology, i mean what does happen that makes sport so good in our body and what biology aspects are those?
I do. So i candy flipped at the String cheese show this past weekend and while I was there I hugged my friend who is a girl from behind. It started out super innocent and kinda lovey dovey but then we started dancing and i got like way too into it, our friends seperated us and she had this look of fear and disgust on her face. We immediately forgot about it and went back to boogying but I can't stop thinking about it, even after I apologized.
I've submitted a couple of updates on this person I'm dating. Basically we've been out three times (I had to cancel on Halloween, if anyone remembers that thread).  We've texted back and forth for about three weeks since we met (online).  She's not a huge texter and last time we hung out (on Monday) we cleared the air on that one (I like to text and I wasn't sure if I was misreading her short answers).

So she tells me on Monday, after we've hung out for like four hours, that she is interested in me. She states she really likes me and is excited about dating me (but we also are taking it really slow...as in no more than hugs so far...even though the last goodbye, we had a more intimate embrace and she was smiling).

All good signs.  She tells me she wants to go dancing soon. I tell her ok I'll see what I can find.

So I text her a fun place to go for Friday night and she says she's taking her kids to the movies (her kids are late teens/20s, fyi) and then states "maybe Saturday."

I asked her today if she just wanted to go for a short walk together (we're both fitness freaks) and she stated she had chores.

And then she was on okcupid this evening. I know because that's how we matched and I got on there and it showed she was on there. 

Now, we aren't exclusive...it's way too early for that. I'm not mad she's on okcupid. I was on there as well. 

But I feel like I'm getting really mixed signals. She likes me, states she wants to date me, has told her friends about me...but has rejected a couple of our dates.

I don't know if all of this is in my head or what.  Does this sound like mixed signals?

I have kids...if they were in their 20s and a woman wanted to go out with my on a Friday night, no fucking way am I going to a movie with them. lol.

Thoughts?  Be gentle. I'm vulnerable right now.
I'll try to keep this as short as possible. 

I moved to a new city after getting a new job and I really struggled making new friends for almost five months. I recently met a really friendly girl and she invited me out to have drinks with her friends, (I'm a guy btw). So I went and she introduced me to her best friend, let's call her Maria. After a couple of drinks I tend to become extremely friendly and that night was no exception. I ended up talking to Maria for a while and I had a really good time. 

Fast forward to the next week and my friend invited me out again for drinks. This time I decided to pregame in order to save some money on drinks so by the time that I got there I was already my super friendly self. There I saw Maria again and I was excited to see her since we had gotten along so well last time. I again end up talking to her a lot that night. At one point after a couple of hours of being there one of her friends pulled me aside and told me how Maria had told them how much she liked me and now all of them were waiting for me to make a move. This completely threw me off since I was just being friendly and was not really interested in anything. 

This situation would have normally been fine. The friend gave me the perfect opportunity to clear things up but instead I panicked and said "Thanks for telling me". Now I cringe at the thought that I could have stopped the whole thing there but I didn't. Now that I'm sober I've been thinking back at my interactions with her and realize that it's my fault that they all were expecting me to make a move. I was so friendly that anyone would have interpreted my actions as flirting. I talked to her almost exclusively, kept constant eye contact, I even asked her out to dance at one point because I like to dance so much.

Now I just feel like the biggest fuckboy and I don't now how to clear things up with Maria without her and her friends thinking I'm a huge asshole.



I'm looking for a song that was sung by a Russian female artist, the song was sung in English and it was kind of House-y. It had 'provocative' dancing in it but I can't remember much else, its really annoying me that I can't remember it. I think it had over 10m views on YT. If anyone can help let me know.

This may not be the right sub for this but it's the best I could find

I don't remember much about the show expect for a single part of it which includes what I remember to be a 3d animated purple dancing on stage with lights flashing behind 

I can't remember what the entire show was about but I remember that it would cut to the cat near the end of the show 

I last saw the show in 2004-2005

And I've been trying to remember it since 2015.

So any help is appreciated

Can you people write here which more MM songs sound like "Post Human" or "Born Again" (Dancing/Funny/Moody) instrumentals?

Tonight following Promeus\_'s awesome mapping stream (why does he make it look so damn easy) someone threw a "Come up with epic weeble ideas"-weeble in the Discord lobby.

As we all know the Diabotical community are first and foremost excellent game designers :)

&amp;#x200B;

This thread has been made in order to facilitate and further the weeble debate. 

I have taken the liberty of naming the weebles where appropriate. 

The weeble ideas are as follows: 

&amp;#x200B;

**"TOXJQ WEEBLE"**:  changes your opponents config to toxjq's 

**"FALSE HOPE WEEBLE"**:  a weeble that manages to make you feel happy for a moment 

**"BRIT WEEBLE"**:  a weeble that says "oi welcum to me game bruv" 

**"DESPACITO WEEBLE"**:  a weeble that plays despacito 

Credit-Weeble is thrown at: *Smileyblue Music*

\-

**"WEEBLE STEALING WEEBLE":** Steals your enemy's weeble

**"AUSTRALIA WEEBLE":**  a weeble that makes your targets camera upside down, 

**"INVERT MOUSE WEEBLE"** a weeble that inverts the mouse input, 

**"ALT TAB WEEBLE"** a weeble that alt+tabs your program, 

**"DAMAGING COMMAND WEEBLE":** a weeble that runs: \[A DAMAGING COMMAND\] on your computer.  

**"COGNITO WEEBLE":** Opens lewd websites in your parents computer. Not in incognito mode. 

**"PIE WEEBLE":**  A Weebl that says "pie"and doesn't really do anything else 

**"FLASH ANIMATION WEEBLE":**  A weebl that makes the most timeless flash animations in the history of the internet 

**"TABLOID-WEEBLE":**  a weeble that if it hits someone it shows you their innermost guarded secrets, with photo evidence so you can blackmail them for the rest of their lives 

**"HAT WEEBLE"**:  no effect, just for profit 

**"YOUTUBE WEEBLE":**  A youtube weeble, this weeble forces your target to let you show them every youtube video you ever thought was mildly unboring, while you excitedly bore them to commit bad 

**"BOOMER WEEBLE":**  A boomer weeble, this weeble is the same as the youtube weeble, but instead of youtube videos, its home videos and poloroids 

**"+5 WEEBLE":**  A weeble that gives you +5 

**"REVERSE UNO WEEBLE"**  A weeble that when used on a target, your target's next rocket is guaranteed to hit you for double damage 

**"STALEMATE WEEBLE":**  when used on a target, any points counted towards one player/team automatically counts towards the other player/team. This weeble is non-reversible, effect lasts until the weeble user quits the game 

**"DEEP FRIED WEEBLE":**  Deep fried weeble, increases your targets cholesterol, and makes them thirsty. Your target will increase in thirst until at least 1 soda is ingested. If maximum thirst is reached before a soda is ingested, 2 sodas must be ingested to quench thirst 

**"MATH WEEBLE"**:  math weeble, put numbers in front of your targets face, confusing them 

**"SPIT-TAKE WEEBLE":**  your target laughs uncontrollably milk goes up their nose and must clean their keyboard, giving you free spawn frags 

**"DANCE WEEBLE":**  Dance weeble, everyone in the AOE must dance to the music, and is invulnerable to damage until music stops Music never stops 

**"CRAZY FROG WEEBLE"**:  Crazy frog weeble, everyone is forced to chase and target you. Code is modified so that all incoming damage misses 

**"MARKIE WEEBLE**":  Markie weeble, plays markies music on repeat because its badass, no other effect 

**"AFK WEEBLE"**:   use on your target, and you go afk. 

**"ORANGE WEEBLE"**:  Target is now infused with vitamin C, and is now marginally resistant to the Common Cold™️ . Repeat uses don't stack, as the Eggbot will urinate out any excess Orange Weebles 

**"OK BOOMER WEEBLE"**:  On impact, target because painfully aware of their age as they are forced to stare uncomfortably into the face of their own mortality. 

**"BLIZZARD WEEBLE"**:  Throw at your target, your target will be hit Soon ™️ . Target will have effects that are subject to change. 

**"BETHESDA WEEBLE**":   If your target chooses, he can pay to continue playing the match, otherwise the targets hard drive is formatted 

**"EA WEEBLE" 3**:  Your target. The rest of the weeble's effect is DLC

My school dance is coming up. I got rejected by 5 girls. One said “they would really want to go but has a babysitting job that day.” The next 3 wasn’t surprising because I didn’t really know them that well. However this last girl snapped me a photo of herself, we went on to talk for 4 hours. I asked her if she wanted to go, and she also said she would love to, except she has the sat next day of the dance, so she would let me know the next day. This girl has ignored my snaps for past two days, clearly she doesn’t wanna go to the dance with me. I hate it how the last girl played with my feelings and then had the audacity to just ignore me.
There's about a 3 year age difference between us. I'm her first boyfriend and really guy she's done anything with. She's my 3rd girlfriend, and 1st one to last more than a few months. We're both college students, and while we're together during the schools year, during breaks we go long distance even though we both live around 3 hours apart in the NYC metro area. Last winter, after about a year of being together, she went to her parent's country to visit relatives for a couple of weeks. While there she went out dancing at clubs with her cousin and friends and she had danced with one guy in particular. This guy knew she was in a relationship but still tried to feel her up and kiss her while dancing. She didn't stop him though, she let him do it and only moved her head when he tried to kiss her on the lips so it would go to her cheek. I don't know about you, but to me, if you're in a relationship with someone, if someone else doesn't respect that you tell them to fuck off. She didn't do that, instead she told me about it like it was a normal thing and it was fun, that she imagined she was dancing with me instead. She got mad at me when I was upset and couldn't understand my problem, she laughed at me when I told her it hurt me. But I forgave her when she came back and we stayed together. Things got better and we decided to move in together off campus. We signed a lease with both of us on it.   
This past summer she was on an internship for her degree, again it would be difficult for me to visit her during it. We stayed in regular contact while she was doing it and really bonded with her roommate. Then there was a guy in the internship that she connected with. One night they pulled an all nighter watching netflix together which turned into cuddling, groping and grinding, but nothing more. The guy ghosted her after and she couldn't figure out why. But that didn't stop her from talking to me about, being preoccupied thinking and talking about it when we hung out, when I spent a crap load of money to hang out with her after not seeing her for 2 months, and all she could talk about was him. She got depressed when he deleted her from snap, and it took over a month for her to stop talking about him. I didn't tell her what happened hurt me, because I didn't want to be laughed at again. I did tell her the guy ghosted her because she didn't fuck him, and that's what the guy was probably looking and when she didn't put out he wasn't interested. But I don't think she understood because she still was hung up on him. We had already singed the lease and put in our deposit plus first/last months rent, and with classes starting so soon there was no time to try to back out or find somewhere else to live. We had sex the first night we moved in, but then sex dropped off. I had posted on here about a month ago about how we hadn't had sex for awhile, it went a month before we finally had it.  
In an attempt to hopefully respark our sex life, I told her she could kiss or screw one guy one time only, hoping that maybe the lack of sex was because she was bored of being exclusively with one guy and by getting off nsa with someone new it would bring her back to me. That didn't happen. She made out with a guy she's been friends with for awhile, and it wasn't for fun, it was because he made her happy, and I don't anymore, but she won't tell me why. And to me, that feels like cheating. I gave permission for nsa fun once without emotions attached, but once she attached emotions to it, it's like I don't measure up anymore, it's more than just attraction or that it's fun, it's getting something emotional that I don't give and she isn't willing to talk with me to try and fix that. When I told her that was the only time, she twisted my words so she could continue making out as sex hadn't happened, when that isn't what I had said. Also according to her, I am not allowed to do the same, only she can.  
And now i'm stuck. Do i forgive her and move on, or find a new place to live now and move out and either break the lease or come to some arrangement with her.

Looking for someone in pdx who's up for great conversation .some adventures around pdx.and  I can host if just dance 2019 sounds like your thing.games, movies, darts, you name it .like the title says dont be shy hmu and upon request I can do picture exchanges. I'm not shy ;)

So I met this guy at a Halloween party and we ended up dancing together and hanging out till it ended. He didn't make a move and when I tried he didn't seem to be into it so naturally I backed off. Fast forward to 3 days ago, I see him at my gym and I smile politely (which is what I would usually do under the circumstance) but he comes over and gives me a nice side hug and jokes around a bit about the night and my workout. 
I'm not sure if he's casually flirting or not, so I can't tell whether I should? He definitely knows I'm attracted to him but I don't wanna make him uncomfortable. Thoughts? 

TL;DR- Met guy from a party at the gym. He's being super friendly, can't tell if he's interested or not. He almost definitely knows I am.
So I have been walking around the city and ended up in a strip club, expecting to see girls dancing, getting tips, etc. What I soon realized is that the place is running a literal scam. They dance only when new customer comes in, demand you to buy them absolutely ridiculously priced drinks and along with bartender trying to upsell the customer as much as possible. After doing some research I realized that it could get much worse and from what I read there's not a single "normal" strip club in Tbilisi, they are all just trying to literally rob their clients by selling them drinks at a price of one week salary in Georgia. Is this really the case or there are places one can safely go?

Hello , I saw a meme of a cute dancing animal , and the song has caught me so bad 
But I cant understand the lyrics 
Here it is .. 

“Forget it, I'll do it sometime, ooh
I'm locked up on the button
Can't you do it sometime?
Pushed it in too far, oh!
Fine, electrify mine, oh”

What is he trying to say here ? and what does “locked up on the button” mean ?? 



Electrify my golden tooth
Can't look at your eyes
Without sparking some
Surprise, I'm in the same time
Beneath the same sun
(Oh, yeah)
Oh man you cut me to size
My little buttercup

“Cut me to size” ??

HiddeVdV96 has been campaigning in Aberdeen for Tommy1Boys, handing out leaflets at a dance centre. HiddeVdV96 is a known lover of ballroom dancing and he is a devoted member of the Classical Liberals. So 1 and 1 equals 2. “Most people don’t know that I did ballroom dancing as a teenager. I wasn’t good enough for national championships, but I had the best time when I did it.”

“Doing sports and exercising increases the health and well-being of people. It’s a good way to start making sure that people are healthier and have better mental health. I know from experience how much of an effect this has on people.”

“The Classical Liberals will fight for better health, Tommy1Boys made sure that Aberdeen has a very good hospital and will continue to fight for better healthcare and equal education for all children in Aberdeen and the rest of Scotland.”

Before I start I just wanted to say this sub is awesome and I genuinely like being here, I can't say the same for some other subs. Either way this question is one that keeps coming up time and time again in my life.

I've always felt inadequate, and I assume it's from the heavy bullying I received throughout school, like movie level shit (kids getting up when you put your lunch tray down, having books get stolen, being picked last, etc). Those negative feelings are always with me, hence why I'm currently majoring in film as I've always to tell stories that everyone can enjoy.

Basically I always end up feeling like I have to prove myself to others. I have accomplished things that I felt like I had to prove to myself I could do. For example, I got rejected alot in highschool, and because of all the bullying I didn't go to the prom, let alone any dance. I felt like I had to prove to myself that I could get a woman to dress up for me, to truly take interest in me and treat me like a human being. Now that I've done that, and way more that I thought it would take years to accomplish.... I somehow still feel inadequate.

Often times I don't approach because I feel like the girl will look down on me as in the back of my head I'm always comparing myself to the guys that do get all the girls and don't get ignored. I'm also thinking about the women who have ignored me, who have looked down on me and treated me like I'm lesser than. Compliments don't help. Women always compliment me in my hair, older women assume I must be a chick magnet, but it's far from that.  

TL;DR: any tips on how to stop comparing myselfto others, feeling like I have to prove myself to women, and feeling bad when others ignore me or look down on me?

I actually ended up here from posting on a sub to make friends. I check the profiles of the people who reply to me and someone posted on this sub. (So if you know me, please just pretend that you didn't see this. Lol)

I'm just browsing the posts on this sub and I think it's nice how serious the guys seem to be. I thought I'd take my chance as I want a serious relationship. And I don't mind being in a ldr. Message me. 

Ps. I'm a small woman from the Philippines. My interest includes reading, dancing and learning/trying whatever seems interesting.

* Reposting because I forgot to add something about me. Edit: I forgot that I can just do this.
Filmed in a gas station and a crackhead at the till is singing something like “I’m the weed man” while the boy and girl who work there dance and I think the girl puts her leg up on the counter ?

When I was a kid, I took dance classes and acrobatics classes and could do all sorts of things. Nowadays, all I can do are cartwheels and back bends. I just tried to do a back walkover, and putting the weight on my hands hurt my wrist really badly!! How can I regain the strength to do back walkovers other types of walkovers again?
Sanic visited George Square to close the campaign. He started by talking to the crowd that had formed.

"I just want to thank you all for really coming out to support me this election. Every time there is a election, the support increases massively, and we just love to see it."

"My opponents don't care about this city. They don't care about you. Glasgow has always had a Green MSP, and I hope you see no reason to stop that now!" 

"Thank you Glasgow!"

Sanic then danced the night away in various pubs and clubs, reportedly buying drinks for everyone after 10 pm all night, which we can believe, because he is the best guy and sound as fuck.

(WP) The Wedding Crasher in Shining Armor

The day of my wedding was unusual, but not in the way that you’d expect.

I was dancing with my husband at the reception, my arms locked around his neck as we swayed on the sun-warmed sand. He smiled down at me, bringing a hand up to my cheek.

“You’ve never looked more beautiful, Natalie,” He whispered, his brown eyes glimmering with looked like tears. “I’m so happy.” I smiled up at him, standing up on my tiptoes to kiss my groom.

“Oh, Liam, me too,” I whispered against his lips, and was rewarded by a joyous laugh.

The guests suddenly quieted down, and even the music cut off. I looked over Liam’s shoulder and saw something absolutely impossible: A knight was walking up the beach, wearing a dark tuxedo over his clanking metal armor. He was grinning, despite being soaked beyond belief. He looked familiar, though I couldn’t quite put my finger on why.

“I am so sorry to be late!” The knight said, smoothing his hair back, smiling at us all, like we were supposed to know who he was, like he wasn’t a complete and total stranger. “Where is my lovely bride? Natalie! I’ve come to marry you!”

I blinked. How did this man, clothed like he’d suddenly appeared out of The Dark Ages, know my name?

“I’m already married,” I said quietly; Liam was looking back and forth between me and this mysterious visitor, puzzled. “I believe your new friend is mistaken,” He said, smiling tightly. I was sure that if Liam had a weapon at that moment, he would’ve challenged the stranger to a damn duel for my honor.

When the stranger got closer, glowering at Liam, I realized just why he looked so familiar: He looked like my imaginary friend, Sir Frederick. But he was a figment of my imagination… Wasn’t he?

Liam let go of me and stomped over to Frederick, eyes narrowed, shoulders tense, drawing up to his complete height, the better to look intimidating.

“Sorry to burst your bubble, buddy, but the bride already has a groom!” Liam said, so loudly that the other guests were beginning to look over, confused and concerned.

Frederick frowned, crossing his arms over his chest. “But I’m afraid I don’t understand, sir. Natalie has been pledged to me since she was seven years old.”

“That’s a lie! Have you lost your mind? Got lost on the way to the insane asylum, huh?”

I walked over, forcing myself in between the two men and pushing them apart; I wasn’t very successful, as Fred was clad in heavy, gleaming armor.

“Liam, that’s enough. Don’t be unkind,” I said, frowning at him.

“Is this true, Natalie? Have you seriously been betrothed to this guy since you were seven?” Liam demanded, eyes narrowed, the color high in his cheeks.

“I mean… It’s not *not* true,” I said, my cheeks turning bright red. I knew what it looked like; like I was lying to my newly wedded husband.

But how was I supposed to explain that Frederick had been my imaginary friend, my knight in shining armor? And more importantly, why wasn’t he imaginary any longer?

is it worth me replacing the rubber heel with leather?

Was diagnosed with Sibo. Have been on antibiotics and high fodmap foods. My joint pain and moodiness has been at a all time high. I’m afraid of everyone. Afraid of them hurting me emotionally, physically, and/or sexually. I am lonely as shit which is only driven from my chronic illness and fear of everyone. My depression has me snapping at every thing and makes me hate myself and not want to be around. I hate everything including myself. I’m stuck with myself all day with no one else to interact with throughout the day. I’m angry, frustrated, unhappy, tired, worn out, Ill, and don’t care to do this dance anymore. I’ve been fighting to get better for 2 years and it has truly felt like a sentence. Life is not worth living if you feel this shit with yourself and in general. I can’t work, I can barely walk, I can barely eat, I have severe food intolerances (which influence a lot of my problems), I feel like I have a disease already brewing so what’s the point of going on. I feel like a whining piece of shit of a person.




My gf and I have been dating for the past 2.5yrs. Living with each other for a year. She moved from NY to NC to be with me and support me, and try to break away from her tiny home town. We even got a cat together after moving in, starting our own tiny family. I plan to marry her, call her my wife. But I messed up. 

Maybe 5 months ago, she has wisdom tooth surgery and was very very loopy. Me being a 21yo guy with raging hormones, still wanted to have sex. But I wasn’t about to have sex while she was loopy on heavy painkillers. I decided to sneak into the bathroom and play with myself instead. I had been doing this before to try and last longer in bed with her. I guess she’s taken notice. 

I knew she had trust issues from previous relationships, and seeing it now, I can see where she’s coming from when she said that it feels like I’m hiding something and might be cheating on her. I reassured her that it wasn’t that, and it was purely just my want to last longer in bed with her. She didn’t really believe it... She says it made her feel like I preferred myself over her, and didn’t want to have any physical relationship. Of course this was absurd to me, as I was doing it purely to have a better relationship, but I saw where it was coming from. 

As time went on, it was gnawing at her, chipping away that I hid it from her, and two days ago, she told me something I wasn’t prepared to hear. 

*“I don’t love you anymore.”*

It came out of nowhere to me. I thought we were doing alright? We just went to my aunts wedding a few weeks ago, where we danced, and laughed, had some amazing times together, even our sex life had picked up. But the events that happened months ago, chipped away until she decided she didn’t love me anymore. 

Sharing a one bedroom apartment, it’s really difficult to bear this. Having to see her, knowing I can’t hug her, kiss her, call her my baby girl. This morning I got up for work and got dressed, and I usually would kiss her in her sleep, tell her I love her, and leave. But today, I just looked at her. Even in her sleep, she is the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, and the most amazing friend I could’ve asked for. I wanted to kiss her, but I held back my tears, and left.  I have never felt pain like this, wondering what to do, literally don’t know what to say? Where to go? Nothing makes sense to me anymore...
I'm sure others might have realized this, but if you haven't then this is  something new. The Sparkle Supreme skin's styles starlight and slow dance are reactive to most emotes that have music., the slow dance style is rather quick to identify but the starlight style is a bit tricky since 3 of the 4 appearances have soley one color. So yeah if you haven't found this out, well now you have


starting a hydroponic garden (me and the ex discussed this and he ever so gentleman like returned the details and layout for this garden when things ended) having at least one cat (I have a preference for maine coons or Norwegian forest cats .... my last cat Chubbers was a long haired orange beautiful sweet majestic maine coon) a dog ... or two hanging out in the sun writing songs, poetry, painting, being barefoot, semi nude, practicing photography dancing and being merry in your solitude?
Hi all.
I have went out and got my 6 year old boy an Xbox one s for Christmas.

BUT. Having noticed there is nothing there for his age group among the game list apart from lego and Minecraft. I looked into a switch.

But seeing comparisons on YouTube. It is a no brainier that the Wii u is basically the same console but reinvented as a switch.

So I purchased a Wii u. Boxed. All wrapped in the plastic. Modded and an external drive. Mame installed as well as 77 Wii u games.

Now I have started it up. Tried the training level on splatoon. Loved it.
Played a 50cc Mario kart race. Awesome.
Played just dance with my phone as sensor.

But.

Without paying fortunes. I cant be using this screen controller for playing games all the time. Surely?

I need at least 4 people to play. Son. Me. Wife. Friend. At the same time on party games and Mario etc.

What can I use and is there differences apart from cost when u get a Wii remote or a Wii plus remote?

Do I need nunchucks?

I want wireless.

Thanks for your help.


I’m looking forward to playing Zelda and smash bros when my boy is in bed.

For as long as my memory,
I have been for someone else.
To dress up, to play with, to criticize. 

For someone else's roving eyes,
Lusting over that which i didn't have,
"Maybe," I thought, "I am beautiful".

"You never get a second chance to make a first impression"
So she highlighted, curled, and teased my hair,
Because mud brown and flat wasn't beautiful. 

I learned what to say and what to wear, and how to impress the boys 
Who themselves learned from hormones and gossip and pantomimes of the real thing. 
Maybe I thought this could be true, and beautiful. 

She took me away from there and told me not to eat,
And we fought and we screamed and I cut (not just my hair)   
In old photos I can see my hurt which came so close to being beautiful. 

Too young I fell pregnant by a man who made me feel wanted,
But he wanted someone else, so I clung to my baby
Because I thought motherhood was going to be beautiful. 

My body decided that beauty wasn't to be mine. 
So I set it aside and healed and tried
To find other ways to be beautiful. 

I dyed my hair vibrant like my art,
Dropped weight and cropped my hair,
I danced until all hours of the night
Control and substances helped make me feel beautiful. 

I thought I loved myself and knew then I had to leave him,
Falling with leaves right into the embrace of new love, and dope. 
Briefly sated, I felt in that moment beautiful. 

Highs are only ever illusory,
So I kicked him and the habit and graduated, Magna cum laude
And success made me feel beautiful. 

New jobs, roommates, colleagues, and bosses,
Slipped me notes and made passes and comments
Because there I was new and beautiful. 

Strangers would stop me or holler or interrupt me. 
Friends would confess to me and lovers harangue me. 
To predators, prey is beautiful. 

Scrambling and screaming and running
Always changing but never escaping
Suffocating, no longer wanting to know
If maybe I am beautiful.

So I have this lingering question of do my friends hate being around me? 

Usually, we hang out every week after school (I'm a senior) and there are usually 6 of us 2 girls 4 boys (2 couples and I am one of the boys without a girl) usually we always hang and binge watch 1 show at a time together I have had a few problems and they all went together to a dance without me and they all went as a group without telling me. I don't know what to think am I just giving myself a hard time?



I’m Brazilian and no, we do not walk dancing around (sambando), we do not live in forests, not all of us play soccer and we do not speak Spanish







Hello. I was wondering if anyone here would be interested in learning to dance with me. I’m too shy to ask anyone to be my partner irl. I attended some beginners’ lessons where I danced with strangers but found it difficult to form meaningful connections. I’m partial toward swing or salsa but I’m open to any kind of social dance. I have practically no experience and definitely no natural affinity for it but I’m very disciplined. I’m in downtown Montreal, toward the village.

Since it might matter, I’m 6’2”, fit but I don’t think I’m very attractive. I also enjoy reading and playing the ukulele.

I look forward to hearing back from you. 🙂

Looking to get into some street dance in Rochester. Anyone know of any classes or clubs, groups of people dancing hip hop, locking popping, etc?





Hey Literal Monsters, Seashell Girls, Gypsies, Cowgorls, Joanne-Reincarnates, Candy Warhols, whatever you happen to be. I found the relationships between all of Gaga's albums to be incredibly interesting, and I want to elaborate on that: 

**Red and Blue:** Red and Blue is a base component, for it has no albums to borrow elements from. 

**The Fame:** Gaga's debut album is a base component, due to the same reason Red and Blue is a base component. This album doesn't view pop culture and fame as an enemy as most albums, but it celebrates it. The Fame doesn't have any elements from any other albums, but it reminds me a lot of Andy Warhol.

**The Fame Monster:** The Fame Monster = Inverted/Darkened Version of The Fame. I don't necessarily view The Fame Monster as a second part of The Fame, but its twisted counterpart, due to the fact it recognizes the warped sides often ignored. Yin isn't the prototype of Yang, they're equivalents. Tracks like Alejandro and Dance In The Dark offer commentaries and odes to the recycled blonde icon, and Bad Romance and So Happy I Could Die expand on Gaga's more personal emotions towards fame, fearing love and fearing addiction. The Fame Monster has a more timeless, trance inspired sound, while it's counterpart is the opposite, being considered 'dated' synthpop. 

**Born This Way:** Red and Blue stumbles upon The Fame, and here they form Gaga's arguably most popular album, Born This Way. Born This Way borrows The Fame's minimal elements of 80's sound and elaborates on it, with tracks such as Born This Way, The Edge of Glory, and many more. However, it celebrates Gaga's roots, blending Red and Blue's acoustic, rock and piano sound with electronic music. Born This Way, conceptually, is an album about 'liberation' and 'freedom', which directly seems to be evolving from 'The Fame', an album that evokes emotions of isolation on tracks like Poker Face, and imprisonment on songs like Paparazzi and The Fame. 

**ARTPOP:** I found this one to be the easiest, it is evidently The Fame Monster, but evolved. ARTPOP celebrates The Fame Monster's electronic sound, with many Europop inspired tracks, except in full album format. While it is overall, a pretty polished record, for such a strange album, like its elder sister, ARTPOP is much odder, with tracks like Aura, Jewels N' Drugs, ARTPOP, Swine, and Mary Jane Holland. It takes on a more 'rave-inspired' sound. ARTPOP is very much an explosion of color and fury, that seems to have been bottled up during The Fame Monster, hence the monochrome visuals and 'empty' aesthetic during 2009-2010. Once 2013 approached, it seems to have been all released into audio and visual form. It takes on the high-concept route, like The Fame Monster. Tracks like Applause, Venus, DWUW, and G.U.Y. remind me of TFM, due to their electronic production and 'softer, polished' sound. Dope also reminds me of Speechless. 

**Joanne:** EvolvedT Red and Blue. Do I need to say more? 

MAN CURED!
I just wanted to type this out somewhere, I feel it might help to process this.

My wife and I have had a tough couple of months. Stress in work has meant that she's been very very snappy with me and we've been one wrong move from an argument all too regularly. She's always been quite volatile, and it's just becoming too much for me recently. I can feel we're starting to pull away from each other, which is an awful feeling as we have a child and life that we both love.

Cue the weekend and I went out with friends, and I got talking to a woman who was very lightly linked to my group. A few drinks in and it turned from conversation to flirting, to dancing, and eventually to kissing (not just once). I did tell her I was married once it became apparent we were flirting, but the seed was sown by then and I just let the barrier fall far too easily.

I'm obviously guilty as hell, I haven't slept well since and am struggling to eat much. I've never had much anxiety or anything so this is quite new to me.

I've got an unexpected problem though which I suspect might be making me feel worse than the first - I can't stop thinking about this other girl. She was incredible and I can't remember the last time I connected with someone new so fast. I'm surprisingly down about the fact that I will never see her again.

I doubt I'll ever tell my wife, especially not yet as I'm still processing and I can't compromise my relationship with my daughter. Anyway, that's my mess, thanks for listening.

TL;DR: I kissed another woman after a tough spell in my marriage. Feeling sick with multi-dimensional regret.

The album misses the original content that makes it great, songs like Good Thing, Ban The Tube Top, The Set Up (You need this) are all missing what made them great, a lot of the OG band members left before it so the band just sounds poorly mixed and the result just looks like a cash grab.

Luckily Reel Big Fish got their act together after that with the Banging albums Life Sucks, let’s dance and Candy Coated Fury.

Shout out to that beautiful girl from Venezuela, thank you for dancing with me on day 3 at neon garden during fisher set. You are gorgeous and you totally made my day. 

Sorry for not taking a photo with you or not asking for your number.. my phone was stolen and I was too shy when you were dancing with me because you are absolutely gorgeous!

Hopefully I can see you again and next time I’ll dance with you all day long!
Let’s grab a drink, watch the leafs play (lose) and go dancing! If all goes well let’s spend the night enjoying each other’s company. Please be intelligent and be able to carry a conversation.
So gonna be completely honest college life has been a shitshow so imma just list out the events in chronological order

I have severe ptsd and I loose sight from time to time which has made going to class hard as fuck. My gpa is a 2.7, I passed calc 1 with a B and physics with an A. I have an internship at a cs lab that deals with online teen safety of minors regarding sexual solicitation and I am currently on a joint project with GT. I won hackathon my freshman year at my school. So like basically anything short term I've done well in but grades and classes are harder as I'm mostly in and out of school which kinda makes it hard to maintain my classes. Also my ptsd is only associated with my college campus. I know chances are low but if anyone has similar experiences lmk.


Back on the dating scene after nearly 20 years - split up with my wife last year, worked on myself, blah blah blah now I'm back at a point where I'm actively looking for someone to share the wonderfulness of my life. Getting out there, meeting people, flirting for the fun of it, living my life. All that stuff. 

Thing is, it's reminded me how I was always, always hopeless at making the definitive, out on a limb, no denying I just put it out there, move. Pre marriage, basically I got a bit drunk, but I'd rather not do that any more. It's not like I'm particularly unconfident, socially, or bad at reading people. I have to do a lot of both for work, and I make new friends and acquaintances really easily. I'm basically a pretty sociable animal, and rationally, I know I'm averagely attractive for my age physically, make people laugh, notice and build on the little looks and 'accidental' touches... but then I have no idea when, how, or whether an actual 'move' will be welcomed. How do other people do it?

Here's an example. Last weekend, I was at a gig with a bunch of Meetup people. Half a dozen of us, all of us met before, and get on well, and without question, I'm hitting it off with one of the women, and I fancy her too. Looks, laughing and shared jokes, odd 'casual' touches, that sense of complicity building. As the band was playing, everybody's dancing and we somehow keep ending up close, and for a few songs, she's in front of me, both of us facing the band and moving kind of together, bodies brushing together, and my hands on her hips now and then.

At which point I should've pulled her closer and escalated a bit, I know. But I wasn't quite sure enough. I mean she wasn't moving away, but she wasn't particularly pushing back against me or anything. So I just kind of kept it at that, and then after the band finished, we all go onto another bar, talking in a group again. Kind of ambiguous and inconclusive.

So how do I get my head round this kind of situation and make the definitive, clear move?
Despite no longer being tiered Six Sam is still annoying to deal with between Shi En and Duel Wield. The only reason they are no longer on the tiered list, in my opinion, is because their biggest monsters are only 2500 Atk which in the current meta can be easily run over while dancing around both Shi En and Duel Wield. If they ever released a six Sam with 3k Atk and introduced it to duel links or even gave us "Gateway of the Six" they would probably return to the tier list.
