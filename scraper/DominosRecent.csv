Hi all,

 I know it hasn't been long since I was here last, but I can't post on RAOP with this account yet. I am registered but if you need proof I understand. Been homeless for a bit now but on a waiting list for subsidized housing. Keeping my fingers crossed for before the cold snap.

Any cheap pizza would be so super amazing. Getting tired of sardines. Dominos is not far from me.

Best to you all.

Just curious, trying to find more options for that asshole. I can breeze thru til that CB but haven't been able to beat him yet. I usually use duped 4/55 Cap IW, 4/55 Domino, 3/45 Masacre, 3/45 Rulk and duped 4/55 GR. I recently brought duped Colossus to 3/45, I'll take him to 4/55 soon. 

What would be best team for taking out the CB? I love the Domino trio bc of the damage output, is the trio plus Colossus and GR my best bet or should I take out the trio and use a Colossus synergy team?
