It’s actually been 25ish days but I’m down 13 lbs - which is over a quarter of the way to my first goal :) 

I ate donuts, I ate pizza, I ate out... but I also cooked at home, subbed almond milk for cream, and tracked everything. I stayed around 1200 calories daily, with a couple days jumping up to 1500/1600 if I was hungry.  I do workout 4x a week, and usually don’t eat back my calories. 

Now I’m on my way to making this a lifestyle and not just a habit!

For reference - I’m 34/5’4”/F. Used to CICO religiously and slacked off for the last few years. Tried keto, it was delicious but I love pasta and bread too much to do that for life.


Tuesday, July 16th

My last day of work in the office! It’s also a full moon. I was hoping that baby would come tonight but no sign of her. My husband and I go to the beach near our house and get ice cream. I noticed the waitress licks ice cream off her thumb before scooping my cone. I resist the urge to vomit, but it’s difficult. We walk (more of a waddle for me) a little bit along the ocean but it’s hot and I’m so uncomfortable we only last a few minutes.

Wednesday, July 17th

It’s my due date! 

6:40 AM I wake up with what feels like strong period cramps. It takes a moment to register that, holy shit, this could be labor. The pain is enough to have woken me up from a sound sleep before my alarm. I get up and pull on a tank top and the only shorts that fit me. I am very uncomfortable. My stomach is tightening and cramping at intermittent intervals. I feel it mostly between my belly button and pubic bone on the very front of my abdomen. I wake up DH and tell him I think I might be in labor. This proves difficult to do because every time the wind has rustled my leg hair for the past 3 weeks I’ve announced “I’M IN LABOR!!!!!!!!” He suggests we take a walk. We stroll (I lumber) around the vernal pool in our neighborhood, stopping regularly so I can hunch over and focus on my breathing. We get back to the house and I am straight up not having a good time. My stomach hurts and the sentient bowling ball in my abdomen is still kicking around against my muscles. I cry for the first time. I have my 40 week appointment with my OBGYN at 11:00 AM at the hospital, and I’m glad. My water hasn’t broken but given the amount of discomfort I am experiencing, my cervix has to be open. It has to. Right?

9:30 AM We get in the car and make a Dunkin run. “I’M IN LABOR!” I announce to the disinterested woman making my large iced caramel swirl. “WITH A BABY!” I specify when she doesn’t make an announcement to the store. 

9:45 AM The car does not feel good. It’s not unbearable, but I’m glad we’re going to the hospital now.

11:00 AM We check in at the hospital and I make sure the receptionist who I’ve seen every week for what feels like exactly 700 years knows I’M IN LABOR. We shuffle back to a room. They do not bother trying to weigh me after I asked if I could remove all of my clothes before doing so the last time.

11:10 AM My OBGYN tells me she thinks I’M IN LABOR and wants me to walk around. I cry for the second time. Partly because this is really happening and partly because it’s hotter than hell and I can’t imagine going back outside and heaving myself forward for even 5 plodding steps. But this biggest part is that I so want this to be real. I want to be in labor. I feel like I’ve been waiting for so long and I desperately want it to happen. She checks my cervix. It is high, tight, and fully closed. She tells me to try walking for a few hours I repeat HOURS and to check back at Labor &amp; Delivery at 4:00 PM. She thinks she will see me with a baby tomorrow.

12:00 PM DH and I walk along the Riverway for about 20 minutes. By this point it is over 90 degrees and I want to choke everyone in sight, especially those with open cervixes. I’m feeling faint from the combination of the heat and pain. The contractions are coming in waves and sweat is dripping off of my head. I stop every few steps to drape myself over a bench. DH and I decide to grab lunch and regroup.

12:15 PM For the first time probably ever, I am repulsed by food. Ok, maybe this is really happening.

12:30 PM I am quite literally melting down. I am now uncomfortable both standing and sitting. It is so hot I can’t think straight. I don’t know how I’m going to make it another 3 ½ hours before going back to the hospital so I suggest we go see a movie. My hope is that I can fall asleep in one of the big easy chairs they have and just relax in the AC. DH doesn’t want to trek all the way over there, and after deliberating in the parking garage we decide to go home instead.

1:00 PM I fucking hate the drive home.

1:30 PM We’re home! And outside, the most apocalyptic storm we have ever seen is raging. It is as dark as midnight and thunder cracks so loud it sounds like it’s coming from inside the house. I pace our apartment and count the minutes until 4:00 PM, when we can go back to the hospital. My contractions are now timeable and lasting 1 minute.

4:00 PM After exactly 700 hours, we can call Labor &amp; Delivery! We relay the message from my OBGYN. They ask how long and far apart my contractions are (5 minutes, 1 minute). They give us the green light to go back in.

4:20 PM I gingerly walk to the car. Every step comes with shooting pain in my uterus. I am convinced I am dying. I think I cry for the third time here- I can’t imagine getting back in that car.

4:30 PM Super surreal drive to the hospital. The storm is raging, it’s raining buckets, and fire trucks and emergency vehicles are everywhere. I use my legs to lift my butt up off the seat every time a contraction hits because even running over a blade of grass with the car sends shockwaves of pain through my body.

4:45 PM Oh good, rush hour.

5:30 PM We arrive at Labor &amp; Delivery! They hook me up to some monitors and ask about my symptoms. A doctor, bless him, comes in and checks my cervix with his knuckle. I am 1.5 cm dilated. At this moment I wish for a vagina dentata to snap off said knuckle and spit it back at him.

5:35 PM They hand me a pile of cold packs and. Send. Me. Home. Again.

5:45 PM Another fucking car ride.

6:45 PM We arrive home and I am bordering on hysterics. I have been in (prodromal) labor for 12 hours now with no progress. My head is spinning trying to imagine the pain it’s going to take for me to get to 10 cm. DH doses me with Benadryl so I can get some rest- I haven’t eaten much and I’m starting to feel loopy. We order a margherita pizza which actually fucking slaps. It registers in my brain that it tastes good, but I can’t enjoy it because of the pain. It feels like my body is being torn in half. It feels like the worst poop cramps I’ve ever had in my life. I am pretty sure my stomach is going to fall out of my butt. Laying down hurts so DH makes me a nest out of pillows and props me up on the couch. 

8:00 PM I fall asleep.

9:30 PM I wake up. The house is dark and DH is snoring soundly. I have a moment of peace and then another contraction hits. The pain is so bad I am fairly certain that pizza will be my last meal. I cringe and say “OW OW OW OW OW” as the pain rolls through me. I start pacing the house, and continue doing so for the next 7 hours. DH wakes up periodically, fearing a wounded goat has gotten lost in our building. I curse him and his demon seed. To say I am straight up not having a good time is the understatement of the millennium. I never knew the human body was capable of withstanding this type of pain.

Thursday, July 18th

4:00 AM I can’t take it anymore and wake DH up to being me to L&amp;D. I’m delirious, moaning, and sweating. We pile back into the car and drive to the hospital (again). 

5:00 AM The sun is coming up over the city and it’s absolutely beautiful. More importantly, I Google celebrity birthdays for 7/18 and am over the moon that my child will share a birthday with Vin Diesel.

5:01 AM I remember I am in crippling pain.

5:15 AM We arrive at Labor and Delivery *again*. We explain how long I’ve been having contractions and they, you know, SEE my agony and offer me a bed in the antepartum unit. Basically the hospital we used is so big that they have a pre-prenatal floor. I go to a room and wait for a nurse.

6:00 AM The nurse comes in and explains my options. Turns out all of my options at this point are, uh, morphine. DH and I had had a discussion about what pain management I wanted (spoiler alert: all of it) in relation to my sobriety. While I certainly was not opposed to pain management, I wanted to be very careful about any narcotics or opiates that the hospital might offer. We explained this to the nurse and she shrugged and said it was up to me. She also mentioned that the morphine might relax my muscles enough to allow my cervix to dilate past 1.5 cms. SOLD. She prepared the morphine and I realize it is an injection. A really really big injection.

6:01 AM An injection that’s going into my butt.

6:05 AM WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Pain? What pain? I mean, I know it’s there but I DON’T CARE. There is a snack cart, too. I eat a chocolate muffin off the cart in a blackout. 

6:20 AM The nurse comes back and asks how I’m feeling. Great! I reply. She reminds me that I can’t get the full course of pain management unless I am, you know, experiencing pain. Oh yeah! Pain! I have some of that! Don’t care, but I have it!

6:21 AM I quite literally turn the other cheek and receive my second injection of morphine. DH notes that my eyes roll in two different directions.

6:22 AM The nurse informs us that my cervix should dilate while I’m resting, but if it hasn’t gotten to a 4 by the time she checks me at noon, she’ll have to send me home. She tells me she’ll return but that if I’m sleeping, she’ll have no choice but to let me sleep longer.

6:23 AM My eyes are still rolling around like marbles but DH informs me that the nurse is a G and has basically given us a free pass to relax in the unit until I am a 4. I have never before wanted to be a 4 more than now.

7:00 AM I rest, but don’t sleep. Time has no meaning. The wallpaper is BEAUTIFUL.

8:00 AM At some point I am pretty sure I hijack the snack cart once more.

9:00 AM The nurse returns. DH is fast asleep. I am not. She looks me dead in the eye and I feel like a kid who has been caught awake on Christmas Eve by Santa. I quickly shut my eyes and she continues with her rounds.

11:00 AM The nurse returns again. I am pretty sure she winks at me but I might just be high as fuck.

1:00 PM The nurse returns once more. She pulls on a rubber glove and approaches my dais, as it were. The moment of truth… I’m a 3.5!!!!!!!! She says it’s good enough for her and sends my ass upstairs in a wheelchair. It’s been nearly 7 hours and I’m still legless from my double shot of morphine.

1:15 PM I meet my Lord and Savior, Saint Abigail, sweet L&amp;D nurse. She gets me set up in my very own delivery room, which is absolutely massive. There’s a window! And a bed for my baby! I’m going to have a baby in this 
room!!!!

1:20 PM I watch a different nurse put actual essential oils on a cotton ball and place it on my pillow. I know for a fact this is not a morphine vision because DH remembers it too.

3:00 PM The morphine starts to wear off and the contractions are even worse than before. I don’t know how this is possible. After 30 hours you’d think my body would have adjusted to them a bit, but no. A shower sounds good to me, but there are two showers for the whole floor and it is down the hall, which at this point, given my pain level, may as well be Siberia. I’m in a johnny, clutching DH’s arm, scooting by bare butt down the hall.

3:05 PM The shower is basically in a janitorial closet across from the nurse’s station, but there is water, and it is hot. And a yoga ball! This all sounds amazing until I strip down and actually start bouncing on the ball. Ow. Ow ow. OW. Pain, oh pain! Somehow the bouncing makes my contractions worse. I lose my mucus plug in the shower. It looks like the saddest blood loogie spat in front of North Station. The hot water feels nice but I am surprised at how much I am not loving the shower/ball combo, which I had been looking forward to for months. I just feel massive, unstable, and slippery. DH helps me get dried off and we slowly make our way back to the room, where…

3:30 PM I SLAM that goddamn epidural button. The hospital keeps an anesthesiologist on the floor at all times so you don’t have to wait long for the epidural. However, Saint Abigail mentions that I will not be able to eat once they’ve placed the epidural, and suggests I order dinner for myself and DH. I order plain pasta like a normal person who just wants to get this goddamn baby out of her and DH, monster that he is, orders the straight up smelliest meal I have ever encountered. I don’t remember what it was but it was probably a dirty shoe stuffed with durian. I contemplate divorce but realize I will probably need a hand to squeeze when the 8 lb game hen wriggling around in my stomach needs to be evacuated. I eat my pasta in silence, breathing through my mouth. 

6:30 PM Saint Abigail brings in the anesthesiologist who is genuinely one of the nicest men I’ve ever met. He’s young, not alarmingly so, but young enough that I want to be stoic and impress him with my ability to take a large hollow needle to the spinal cord. They tell me DH needs to leave which freaks me out, because I wanted to be able to hold his hands and literally lean on him when they threaded in the epidural. Apparently they need a sterile environment and husbands aren’t a part of that. So he leaves, I strip down, they tape a cloth with a square cut out of it to my back, and wash me down twice. Mind you, my contractions are slamming into me this entire time. Abigail reads the consent form to me one more time and I shakily sign it. The anesthesiologist has me lean all the way forward on to Abigail and take a deep breath in and release it. I feel literally NOTHING. I had panicked about the epidural for actual months and it felt like nothing. I feel a strange sensation like cold water being poured down my body and then what felt like what I can only describe as static in the lower half of my body. I resist the urge to deep tongue kiss the young anesthesiologist- I can’t believe it’s over!- and Abigail helps me get situated back in bed.

6:32 PM DH returns and I confess my impure thoughts about the anesthesiologist.

6:35 PM I post on Facebook that I want to buy epidurals for all of my friends.

6:45 PM I drunk dial my coworker using Facebook Messenger video (even though I have her phone number) because everyone is at the company’s summer party. She doesn’t answer.

7:00 PM Abigail’s shift is ending but she tells me she’ll be back in the morning. I am sad to see her go, especially because the new nurse has the personality of a ball of lint. We decide that now is a good time to try to get some sleep before things get really crazy. The doctor estimated that I’d be ready to push in a few hours so I snuggle in to bed with my dead legs and drift off.

7:30 PM One of the many monitors hooked up to my half-limp body bursts to life with a shrill melody. A blood pressure cuff beeps and tightens on my bicep. Lint Ball saunters in to check my vitals. I feel strange and have the urge to reach down to my vagina parts. I don’t feel my hand touch them but my hand touches something syrupy. I am pretty sure my water has broken. Linty pulls back the sheet and sure as shit, my water has broken. She wipes me down with towels and I don’t feel much. She has to go back several times with more towels, like way more towels than you would think one would need to clean up a small pool of amniotic fluid. DH later describes the fluid and tissue that she removes as looking like a diseased jellyfish.

7:45 PM I drift off to sleep without my jellyfish. I wonder how the baby can breathe or more in there now.

8:00 PM The blood pressure cuff beeps and tightens.

8:30 PM The blood pressure cuff beeps and tightens.

9:00 PM The blood pressure cuff beeps and tightens.

9:30 PM The blood pressure cuff beeps and tightens.

9:48 PM DH snores heartily.

10:00 PM The blood pressure cuff beeps and tightens. I search for something to throw at DH’s head.

10:12 PM An alarm screeches next to me. The monitor for the baby’s heartbeat has slipped down from my stomach. Lint Ball takes this very personally.

10:30 PM Beeping, tightening.

11:00 PM Tightening, beeping.

11:30 PM This is my life now. 

11:59 PM I guess my daughter won't share a birthday with Vin Diesel after all.

Friday, July 19th 

12:00 PM Beeping, tightening. Maybe I can sleep through it?

12:30 PM Beeping, tightening. No.

1:00 AM LB tells me I’ll be 10 cms and ready to push in a matter of hours. She advises me to get some rest. 

1:02 AM I take an internal vow of celibacy.

1:30 AM I have reached the bargaining stage.

4:30 AM Holy shit, I slept?!?!

4:45 AM LB informs me that I’m 9 cm. She sticks a peanut ball betwixt my knees to help the baby get into a better position. Once that’s situated she tells me she’s going to check in with the on call doc and will return shortly for me to push!!!!

5:10 AM LB is back. We wake up DH. It’s go time. Oh my god. I’m going to push a baby out of my vagina hole.

5:15 AM DH has one leg and LB has the other. LB tells me to take a deep breath in and bear down for ten seconds. She counts to ten with such ferocity that I can practically see the slide in the PowerPoint that the Labor &amp; Delivery nurses had to read about motivating patients. I can’t stand her.

5:30 AM I understand that DH is trying to be helpful but he is loudly chewing Nicorette in my ear and not pushing a baby out of his vagina hole.

5:45 AM I feel like nothing is happening. The routine is 10 seconds of pushing, take a breath, 10 more seconds of pushing, take a breath, 10 more seconds of pushing, rest. I’m definitely pushing for the first ten seconds, but the subsequent rounds aren’t doing anything. DH and LB insist that they are.

6:00 AM LB has me get on my side to try pushing from there. She’s still putting unnecessary exclamation marks after every number she counts off.

6:30 AM LB and DH can see the head. I reach down and touch it but don’t feel anything. They explain that they can only see baby’s head while I’m pushing, then it retracts back when I stop. LB asks if I want The Mirror. Bitch of course I want The Mirror!!!!!!!!! I didn’t gestate this creature for 9 months just to look away when she wormed her way into the world! I’m a girl who loves looking at discarded pore strips up close and took 55 photos of my pregnancy bloody nose wreckage, of course I want to see the baby come out of my vagina!

6:31 AM Maybe I don’t want to see the baby come out of my vagina.

6:32 AM Wow I really haven’t shaved in a minute.

6:33 AM I really feel like my vulva doesn’t fit my personality.

6:40 AM I have officially been in labor for two days and your girl is tired.

6:45 AM LB has me change positions again and brings out some sort of home gym apparatus that I’m supposed to use as a pull up bar whenever I push. I?????

6:50 AM LB loops a sheet around the pull up bar and tells me to try using that for leverage. For some reason this actually works for me, but I’m so exhausted I can’t do it for long.

6:55 AM Ladies and gentlemen, LB has left the chat. Oh my god, Saint Abigail is back!! This gives me a burst of energy. And I continue pushing pushing pushing. It’s been nearly 2 hours.

7:00 AM Oh my god I am tired. 

7:10 AM No human has possibly ever been this tired, ever. I am tired and sweaty and I realize my lips are so chapped. I ask DH for my Bite Beauty Agave Lip Mask in my purse. He hands me a tube of Nivea Moisture Lip Care. I ask him if that looks like the Bite Beauty Agave Lip Mask. He rummages around in my purse some more and pulls out Huda Beauty Liquid Matte Lipstick in the shade Bombshell. I look at him and blink. I really don’t want to fight in front of Abigail. I blink again, aggressively. He hands me the purse and I immediately pull out the Bite Beauty Agave Lip Mask.

7:25 AM Pushing is a little easier with Abigail’s encouragement, but I still feel like nothing it happening. My assbone hurts like hell though.

7:45 AM I am overcome with nausea. I vocalize this and Abigail holds an emesis bag while I empty my stomach of plain pasta. I feel… wrong. She takes my temperature and sees I have spiked a fever. She checks my fluid with a white towel and it has taken on a nasty greenish tinge. Baby’s heart rate spikes. She quickly tells me that baby needs to come out NOW. I push like hell and continue vomiting periodically.

7:55 AM A doctor enters the room and reiterates that baby needs to come out NOW. He asks if I’m up to pushing any more. I am not. I’ve been in labor for 49 hours and pushing for 2 ½ hours. We call it- I’m having a C-section. For some reason I ask if it’s an emergency. He informs me that if it were, we wouldn’t be having this discussion.

8:00 AM After the doctor leaves the room Abigail informs me that I am next in line for surgery, jumping to the top of the queue for scheduled C-sections. I feel very VIP, and very scared. She tells DH to pack up the room because we won’t be coming back after the procedure.

8:10 AM Abigail wheels me out of the room. Bye room! She explains that because I am having surgery, DH will need to cap and gown up. I am so terrified I can’t think straight but for some reason the notion of his bald head in a hairnet is very entertaining to me.

8:15 AM I’m in the surgery room. It is very bright and very cold. There are about 15 people in there and the radio is playing. They strap my arms down and hang a curtain across my body, blocking everything below my shoulders from view. No one really explains what’s happening and I have never been more scared in my life. 

8:20 AM I am told that they are going to wash my stomach. They wash it twice. I am told that they need to shave some of my pubic hair. I am grateful and a little disappointed I’m too out of it to make a Brazilian wax joke. They do not bring out the power tools for the shaving. I am incredulous. Everyone is talking over each other and I am panicking because I can’t imagine how they can understand each other. I’m about to be cut open and they’re all carrying on like it’s a family reunion. Again, the radio is playing. I’m afraid they’re going to miss something. It seems so chaotic and disorganized. I get my wish a moment later when the radio cuts out and the entire room falls silent. Deathly silent. The lead doctor states my name, date of birth, medical record number, and procedure to be done. I have died. I am sure they are reading my obituary. There is a beat of complete silence, then the radio starts up again and everyone resumes chatting. 

8:25 AM The doctor next to my head tells me he is going to give me some more medicine in my epidural. When I had the epidural in my old room, I could roll from side to side with minimal help. Once he turns on the drip in here, it is as though my body does not exist below my shoulders. He explains that he is going to touch me in various places and instructs me to tell him when I feel it. 15 seconds go by. 20. 30. I feel nothing. I tell him he can touch me now and he laughs. He tells the other people in the room we are all set to go. The procedure begins and DH is nowhere to be found. I frantically try to get the anesthesiologist’s attention. “Where’s my husband?” I ask. “I need DH. Where is he?” I feel pushing and pulling and see movement below the curtain. I am begging someone to get DH or tell me where he is. Everyone is wearing masks and it is so loud in the room and I am so loopy from drugs and adrenaline that I can’t understand what anyone is saying. One sweet nurse stands over my head and pets my face in an effort to calm me down. She speaks to me and I understand nothing. I am in a pure panic that they are going to take the baby out before DH gets here. I keep asking where he is, when suddenly I hear his voice in the doorway. An OR Technician walks him over while loudly saying “OK Dad, up here! Look right up here! Over here!” and I realize that my insides are definitely on the outside and they don’t want him to look. He sits down next to me and we both start crying. After all this time, our baby is going to be here any minute.

8:30 AM I feel sick. I tell DH I’m going to throw up and a doctor gets me another emesis bag. The room is spinning. I lean over and vomit several times. 

8:45 AM DH and I are still both crying, him more than me. I'm mostly just... high. I am shaking so bad from the drugs and the temperature of the room that my teeth are chattering. I continue to weakly spit thick saliva out of my mouth as the waves of nausea send dry heaves through my body. I am dizzy. Something is definitely wrong. I try to tell DH but I am shaking so badly that my jaw is locking up and I struggle to get the words out. I am so incredibly disoriented and my eyes roll back in my head. “DH,” I say, “I’m dying. Something is wrong. I’m dying. I’m pretty sure I’m dying. DH.” I cling to consciousness as best as I can because I really, really want skin time with my baby right after she comes out.

8:59 AM SHE’S OUT! Everyone says she’s here but I don’t see her or hear her. I had asked for the plastic curtain so I could see her come out but they immediately whisk her away. She still isn’t crying. I ask DH why she isn’t crying. He tells me it’s ok, it’s normal. I know it is not. I demand for the doctors to tell me why she isn’t crying. I start sobbing. Why don’t anyone tell me what’s wrong with her?

9:00 AM DH and I agreed that should the baby need him, she was to go with her. That was all well and good when I was still pregnant and lucid, but now that I was cut open on a table I was all, “Oh so you’re just gonna leave me?”

9:02 AM I still haven’t heard the baby cry. Everyone is carrying on as though things are normal. DH is in the far corner of the room with a bunch of people.

9:05 AM DH comes back to me. He is holding our baby. She is awake and looking at me with big grey blue eyes. She is fine. She is silent. Our baby. Our daughter. “That’s my daughter,” I say before losing consciousness completely.

I have no idea what time it is when I wake up, but there are much fewer people in the room. DH is sitting next to me staring at Penny and rocking her gently. I’m still strapped to the table and I still feel wretched. I ask the doctor how much longer it’s going to be and he sighs. SIGHS!!! He explains that Penny had gotten stuck and in doing so, her head had rammed against my bladder. When they catheterized me for the C-section, blood poured out of the line (DH apparently watched this happened and wisely did not tell me until long after). The doctor said it would be another 45 minutes because he needed to do an endoscopy and run a camera up to my bladder to assess the damage. During this time I start to feel slightly human again and coo at Penny. Apparently she HAD cried, I just hadn’t heard. DH said I probably lost consciousness because my blood pressure was 55/28- he was watching it tank as I was telling him I was dying. Penny’s first APGAR score was 4, and she was quite blue. She had aspirated meconium and gone into fetal distress, hence my fever and her heart rate spiking. The nurses suctioned out her airway and got her breathing on her own and her second APGAR was 9. DH never left her side.

This game releases on Friday and it looks like a pre-alpha build with the white void background and NPCs popping in and out: [https://clips.twitch.tv/TemperedDifferentPizzaTBTacoRight](https://clips.twitch.tv/TemperedDifferentPizzaTBTacoRight).

So... I got reminded of another story about my shitty bio father. On the internet, you can choose wether or not to read these kinds of stories so I don't have as nearly ad bad guilt about ruining someone's day when I have a flashback.
Cast- GU- Great Uncle
C- cousin
MM- my mom
ESF- Entitled Selfish Father
MS- my then 10 year old sister
AG- adopted grandma

I'm thirteen years old and this takes place at my grandma Karen's visitation. Despite online culture, she was the best grandma in the world: taught me sports, music, manners, homework skills and generally made me feel safe and loved every time I went over. She had just died of terminal cancer and other infections. It was very hard to say goodbye to the woman who helped raise and love me.

MM and ESF had seperated during Grandma's stay in hospital due to ESF being a total dickhead. Ei: he accused her of having an affair while my grandma was dying, he couldn't understand why she was so upset, he wanted her to devote after work time to cleaning and cooking, not caring for her dying mom.
This was late May and the weather was getting nice. The whole winter had been a blur of hospital visits and failure math and french, living on donated french fries and pizza with my mom becoming more and more depressed.

The day grandma died, ESF decides to come back into the picture. He tried to take me into "getting the family back together". This involved taking me for drives for ice cream or Chinese food, having me pick out gifts for mom and MS to "make them feel better". Being the then oldest, I wanted everyone to be happy and saw this as my job.

Then... This day.

I was at the second visitation. My GRANDMA wad loved by so many and had people traveling cross country and international flights to see her. She had old friends, co-workers, people from her churches (2), family, ect... And ESF was there trying to worm his way back into our female dyad while taking advantage of mourning donuts and chocolates.

"&lt;storylassie1995&gt;, I need to get out of here. Take me for a walk. It's too depressing."
Never mind he was over 50 and should not need a 13 year depressed girl to accompany him. He had lived in this town long enough to know where he could go to get away. He even took his own vehicle.
Me, being a stupid kid wanting everyone to be happy, says "we can walk to the cat adoption place down the road. But not too long. I want to be here to honour grandma."
He nods and tells my GU "I'm taking my daughter, she's getting upset."
GU nods to him. GU and ESF have bad history involving a fight from 1990.
Entitled Selfish Father walks me past my sister, cousins and mom out the door. My poor mother looking ashen.
"Mom, are you okay?" I run to hug her. 
ESF says "she'll be fine. Common!" 
Everyone knew to jump when ESF said jump.
He asked me a question about mom and if she was having any visitors. I told him about the cadet party and told him it was girls only (lies... There was one other woman and four men). Then I told him I was sad and he said that we honour our dead for while then we have to move on. He offered to take me back to his house and I refused. "No, I'm living with mom. We can talk but I'm going with mom and sissie."
"Your mom is getting sick and old and needs me. She will die sooner if she is all alone. Your grandma died alone, do you want that happening to your mom?"
I was in shock and just said no. He held my hand and said I was a good girl.
I will never stop blaming myself for me being part of the reason for moving back in with him. I was a stupid child.

TLDR: my ESF removed me from my grandma's visitation under the guise of him not takind death well, isolated me and gaslighting to make my mom move back in with him. I was a tool.

### Premier Tier

There were no major upsets in the quarterfinal round. 11 of the top 12 teams advanced, and only two teams below a three seed — 4 seed Texas and 5 seed Iowa State — advanced. 

Rose|Orange|Sugar|Fiesta
-|-|-|-
[Texas A&amp;M](#f/texasam)|[Florida](#f/florida)|[LSU](#f/lsu)|[Oklahoma State](#f/oklahomastate)

*Best of luck to all!*


Hey, I’m sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with 3 other girls. My roommate and I both eat kimchi, while my 2 housemates don’t. 
I have heard one of them complain to her roommate a few times but never to me. It’s been 2 months living with her with no direct food complaints until today. I was eating lunch with a side of kimchi and she said she can’t put up with the stench of it anymore. She told me about her headaches she gets from smelling it every time. I told her I realize most people are put off by its smell, but I’m really disgusted by the smell of cheese too, which she makes a lot food with. She makes pizza and cheesy pasta all the time and I can’t stand them too but I put up with them because we’re housemates who need to compromise. I said if my roommate and I can’t have kimchi here, then she and her roommate can’t have cheese here. She told me it’s way different and kimchi is way more smelly, to which I respond that I see it the opposite way. She stormed off to her room.

I decided to combine my two favorite things in the world, food and music, and take some of the biggest pop albums with reviews on Pitchfork and match that score to corresponding restaurants with the same score courtesy of The Infatuation, which is basically Pitchfork for food. Enjoy.

[Lana Del Rey - Norman Fucking Rockwell!](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell/ )/[Carbone](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/carbone) (9.4)

Lana Del Rey May not be Italian, but Norman Fucking Rockwell is an album that is as bombastic and 2016’s La La Land. And just like La La Land, there’s nothing whiter than being really into old shit. Carbone is a dusty ass Italian restaurant that looks like it’s where Lana recorded this album - she probably stumbled upon here while looking for the Mariners Apartment Complex, or something.

[Taylor Swift - Lover](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-lover/)/[Gotham Bar And Grill](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/gotham-bar-and-grill) (7.1)

This may not be the dive bar on the east side Taylor was talking about, but do you really expect this bitch to hit up Welcome to the Johnson’s or any place below four dollar signs on google? Lover is like the Anthropologie version of When Harry Met Sally so yeah, this is her bar. Oh, and Taylor Swift still doesn’t understand there are bars out there that don’t serve beef tartare.

[Kim Petras - Clarity](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kim-petras-clarity/)/[Eataly La Pizza &amp; Pasta](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/eataly-la-pizza-pasta) (7.2)

Just like Eataly’s former owner Mario Batali, Kim Petras’ owner just could not give a single fuck about consent. Also, this restaurant got a lower score than a 7.2, but that’s because this sorry excuse for a trap pop album deserved worse.

[Lizzo - Cuz I Love You](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lizzo-cuz-i-love-you/)/[Yves](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/yves) (6.5)

Lizzo’s triumphant rise to stardom is one of 2019’s greatest success stories. But, perhaps what is looked over is the fact that she did it all while making music for tampon commercials. Truly remarkable. Yves in TriBeCa is a restaurant that looks good but then you actually have to eat the food and it’s not good. I’ll take a Truth Hurts and Good As Hell instead please.

[FKA Twigs - Magdalene](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fka-twigs-magdalene/)/[Alinea](https://www.theinfatuation.com/chicago/reviews/alinea) (9.4)

Okay, shut up, Alinea is in Chicago. But there’s not a single restaurant in NYC that’s anything like it - in the same way that there’s no album like Magdalene. That’s because no one wants to listen to the recorded croons of a dying swan set aflame in a factory that manufactures DVD players. Well, no one besides y’all. For those unaware, Alinea is an “experimental” restaurant, which is slang for overpriced deconstructed tasting menus. You literally eat a fucking balloon. A goddamn balloon. 

[Charli XCX - Charli](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/charli-xcx-charli/)/[The Polynesian](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/the-polynesian) (7.8)

Unlike the rest of the places on this list, I’ve BEEN to this place. And while it doesn’t look like the inside of a robot vagina, it is still the perfect embodiment of Charli XCX. It’s a ritzy rooftop tiki bar, a place where rich people can sit and order an $85 giant fucking cocktail inside a literal fishbowl. And at the end of the day, that’s what Charli XCX is - Cascada for people who subscribe to Anthony Fantano.

[Ariana Grande - thank u, next](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ariana-grande-thank-u-next/)/[The Good Fork](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/the-good-fork) (7.9)

What restaurant better fits Ariana Grande than an American one that throws in Asian elements just because it sells? Oh, probably a gentrified chicken and waffles place in Brooklyn where the only requirement to work there is to wear a beanie and listen to Angel Olsen at least once a week. But, I couldn’t find a review for any place like that, so this is the next best thing. Thank you, Ari-Chan.

[Billie Eilish - When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/billie-eilish-when-we-all-fall-asleep-where-do-we-go/)/[Minnie’s](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/minnies) (7.2)

The Infatuation describes Minnie’s as a place you go to when “you don’t have a reservation on a Friday night,” and that perfectly sums up Billie Eilish’s debut. It’s got a bit of hype, and there’s some good stuff here, but the fries taste almost exactly like McDonald’s, they’re just $10 more. When you’re all out of FKA Twigs and Lana Del Rey at home, I guess you begrudgingly have to make the trek to listen to I Love You and pretend it’s Video Games.

[Lil Nas X - 7](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-nas-x-7-ep/)/[Laurel’s Hardware](https://www.theinfatuation.com/los-angeles/reviews/laurel-hardware) (4.3)

What better place to describe Lil Nas X’s debut EP than a restaurant named after a hardware store, as the whole project sounds like it was manufactured and committee tested like a fucking Craftsman home. As The Infatuation says, “at this point, you’re having a terrible time but at least it’s at the portion of the evening where the more recognizable faces from porn begin to arrive and you get that second wind.” And that porn star in question is Old Town Road, the last song on the EP, and it’s truly telling as it’s also the first song, except worse. Oh, and you’re probably realizing now that 7 isn’t even an album, it’s an EP. I bet you didn’t realize that this place isn’t even in NYC, it’s in West Hollywood. About as authentic as this record!

[Caroline Polachek - Pang](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/caroline-polachek-pang/)/[Death Stranding](https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review-delivering-the-goods-11022052/) (7.3)

Yeah, don’t even go outside and find a restaurant, just stay at home on a cold day, take DMT, and play Death Stranding. Pang is basically that, but with more bananas (although not as bananas as the plot in any Kojima game). Side note: the cover shows Caroline climbing a ladder on the cover because she’s climbing out of the cesspool that is /r/popheads!

[Carly Rae Jepsen - Dedicated](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/carly-rae-jepsen-dedicated/)/[Gato](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/gato) (7.3)

The Infatuation says “The food isn’t nearly as good now as it was back then.” That is all.

[Madonna - Madame X](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/madonna-madame-x/)/[Lexington Brass](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/lexington-brass) (4.8)

Lexington Brass is an upscale tourist trap - it’s what people imagine the great restaurants in NYC are like, and on the cover, it looks like it could. Like Madame X, once you actually dive into it, you realize it’s just white people serving you watered down versions of Latin American shit. Honestly might be a good place if you want to practice your “ok boomer” retort.

[Sigrid - Sucker Punch](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sigrid-sucker-punch/)/[Bozu](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/bozu) (6.0)

Sigrid’s Sucker Punch is a decent album, in the same way that Bozu is a decent sushi restaurant. If you don’t have the energy to make it to Manhattan or listen to Aurora, then yeah, they’re both good picks. And just like sushi, Sigrid’s album is undercooked and good in small quantities. But my god this shit makes me sick if I have too much of it.

[Clairo - Immunity](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/clairo-immunity/)/[Egg](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/egg) (8.0)

I’m really grasping at straws here. Maybe Clairo likes eggs? She likes flaming hot Cheetos, so I truly have no clue whether or not she consumes eggs. Maybe there’s some joke in here about how eating eggs helps your immune system? Or maybe the real joke is that Rostam left Vampire Weekend to produce this?

[Beyoncé - Homecoming](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beyonce-homecoming-the-live-album/)/[Uncle Boons](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/uncle-boons) (9.3)

Both front row to see Beyoncé and a seat at Uncle Boons are two things I won’t get to experience, because trying to get Bey tickets and a seat at Boons are similar experiences - they both require a ton of drive, determination, and being born into a wealthy family that allows you to not have to work and instead you can just have the time and money to camp on Ticketmaster/Spring St. And, I imagine the audience is the same too - post self-titled fans are probably people who just started liking Thai food. You see, I wasn’t too good for either years ago, Alexa play Irreplaceable.
Alright folks, instead of the normal depressing content on the sub, Christmas is coming early ...though perhaps a bit boring. This is like getting socks. But hey, I know a lot of you need socks, so it's not that bad.

Common problem I'm sure a lot of you are facing is how to reach essay minimum page requirements. I'm here to help. This is only really looking at one specific technique, there's lots of others, and maybe I'll do write ups on them also. The key here though is that this *isn't* about just padding your essay. It's about reaching the minimum length *by doing what you're actually expected to do.* It's like cheating on a test by smuggling notes in your brain.

Let's take a hypothetical essay discussing polarizing foods. Here's a stereotypically bad bit of (hypothetical) student writing:

&gt;One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. In Haidt's article he finds that 40% of people hate pineapple on pizza. This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.

Shit. We just covered pineapple in like 2 lines of text. That was going to be the centerpiece of the essay!

To improve on this, always look for more clarity, depth, and specificity. We'll start with the first sentence. ...Is there evidence of this debate we can point to?

&gt;One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post ranked pineapple on pizza as the most controversial food.

Good start, but what lots of details are missing.

&gt;For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial and pineapple was the clear winner.

Better, but we're using an internet sources a lot of folks aren't familiar with. Is it credible? More detail helps:

&gt;For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net 14,000 upvotes and 3,000 comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked 7th, 14th, and 17th.

Our first sentence has now become longer than the entire original paragraph just be expanding on the "causes a lot of debate" idea. Now let's move on to "In Haidt's article he finds that 40% of people hate pineapple on pizza."

First we need to tell the audience who this guy is.

&gt;Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust.

After that, we should give more detail about just what the study found (I'm making up the study, btw, but Haidt does study disgust). We should provide more detail about the specific research results, and can add a bit of narrative about the research methods as well.

&gt;In a study of 300 college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is "strongly dislike" and 5 is "strongly like," 40% of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at 1, while 30% ranked it at 5. Only 3% put it in the middle with a rank of 3.

In the original, 40% disliking it didn't actually tell us it was controversial, it told us only a lot of people hate it -- but we need to know how many like it as well, and the number of ambivalent people is another useful detail. We can go into more depth with some added context drawn from other questions in the study:

&gt;While pineapple had 70% of all respondents answering 1 or 5, sausage only had 30% in either category, with only 5% saying they strongly dislike it.

Good, that tells us how it compares to an uncontroversial topping. How does it rate among other controversial toppings though?

&gt;Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had 40% ranking it 1 or 5, bell peppers had 30%, and mushrooms were at 55%. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with 90% having a strong opinion, though 85% ranked it at 1, showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.

Holy cow, now we've got ourselves a real life college essay paragraph. Let's put the pieces together and see how she looks:

&gt;One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net 14,000 upvotes and 3,000 comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked 7th, 14th, and 17th. Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust. In a study of 300 college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is "strongly dislike" and 5 is "strongly like," 40% of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at 1, while 30% ranked it at 5. Only 3% put it in the middle with a rank of 3. While pineapple had 70% of all respondents answering 1 or 5, sausage only had 30% in either category, with only 5% saying they strongly dislike it. Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had 40% ranking it 1 or 5, bell peppers had 30%, and mushrooms were at 55%. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with 90% having a strong opinion, though 85% ranked it at 1, showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.

That's more than half a page (TNR 12, double spaced).

Now what about the last line from the original? "This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza."

Cut it. Don't need it. If I clearly showed you something, I don't need to tell you that I clearly showed you it. You know.

But wait, we're not done! We can get even more mileage out of this by commenting on the limitations of the study:

&gt;It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and there may be a regional preference.

Again, we can expand this with greater levels of detail and specificity.

&gt;It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and regional preferences may have influenced the results. Food preferences and traditions are known to vary from one region to the next, and pizza in particular has regional variations such as the Chicago deep dish. It may be that in some places were pineapple is more popular, pineapple on pizza is less of a contentious issue.

And, if you need to squeeze a little more mileage out of it, add a bit of your research narrative:

&gt;However, in researching this topic, I was not able to find a study that compared regional attitudes towards pineapple on pizza.

That's all there is to it.

...One huge caveat of course. Expanding your writing in this way first requires that you have a clue what the heck you're talking about. You need to have done the research, have actual good sources, and understand the sources and your subject to be able to discuss it in a nuanced manner. If you're still in camp "lol didn't read," this isn't going to help you much.

I'm a Toronto fan making the drive down to Pittsburgh for the game this weekend. I have a bucket list thing where I'd like to see the Leafs play in every NHL barn (you guys will be stop #11) and since Pittsburgh is a surprisingly drivable distance from Toronto, I thought I'd pop by and visit.

I won't have a ton of time as I'll be headed back Sunday afternoon but what would you guys say are some musts to do as a tourist in Pittsburgh? Some good food suggestions (I basically devour Mexican food, but I'm open to a lot of standard chicken and pizza places) would be awesome as well.

Relating to the game more specifically, what time do the gates at PPG Paints open? I'm also curious if there are any nearby bars where I could maybe grab a drink and chat with some of the locals that is fairly popular among the Pens faithful.

Thanks!

Surprised this podcast wasn't talked about enough. Searched around and barely seen a discussion about it, which is crazy since Cara seems to be the talk of the town lately. She spilled a lot of tea about this season and things that haven't been shown to us. 

• Says the fake breakup was because everyone overanalyzes everything they do and people are so desperate to see them fail and was to give a big middle finger to everyone who hates on them.

• Says that the Kyle-Paulie-Cara devils triangle is officially dead.

• Paulie says Kyle begged and pleaded to Paulie not to send him in his final elimination in war of the worlds season 1.

• Takes a shot at Nany and says "don't just sit around, smoke cigarettes and drink wine all day"

• Says Leroy was part of their alliance from the moment Johnny left 

• Says turbo was secretly part of their alliance too and was bummed when he left 

• Says her and Laurel can't mend their friendship. Says that if Laurel was more focused on winning then taking Cara out then she wouldn't have gone home.  

• Says she wouldn't even look at Ashley at first but Paulie brought them together and Ashley genuinely wanted to run with her in a final 

• Says she sees a lot of herself in Ninja and that Ninja is everyone's scapegoat now when it used to be her. 

• Says before the Laurel/Ninja elimination the Laurel/Bananas alliance was in the back of the bus taunting them and being obnoxious while Cara and her alliance were upfrong being quiet and kept to themselves. 

• Says the cast was having a pizza night and Ninja just said something innocent like "oh we're having pizza" and Jordan just snapped and was absolutely mean and horrible to her for no reason at all and would poke at her all season and even made her cry at certain times. 

• Says Johnny is the most selfish human being and is a hypocrite for criticizing her relationship with Paulie yet aligning with Kyle who did Cara dirty. Says the difference is Paulie has a brain of his own and thinks for himself and Kyle is a follower and will do whatever he says. 

• Says Bananas never liked Paulie from the moment he saw him in final Reckoning and would make fun of him all through out that season.

• Georgia's beef with Cara just stems from them being on different alliances. Says Georgia took the game too personally.

• Says she got along with Jordan in Free Agents and half of Dirty 30. Says on Dirty 30 he was disgusting towards Jemmye, Veronica, Aneesa, and herself. Says what sealed the deal was in the redemption house in dirty 30, Jordan body shamed her (said she had a man's body) and kept telling her she was weak and nobody wanted to run with her in a final.

• Says in the Vendettas reunion Jordan kept yelling at Cara telling her she didn't deserve to win and she was weak which got to her and made her cry.

• Says this is the first season she's had a real official alliance.

• After Turbo got sent out the house for 3 days, Jordan went around to everybody in the house saying if Turbo comes back he's gonna let Turbo hit him and that he's gonna sue production and take legal action since he was already threatened before. At the same time Tori was rallying production and telling them to not bring Turbo back and that she feared for her and Jordan's safety.


I've been testing the law for a while now and I want to share with you my success stories.

The first success story I want to share with you is by using SATS: In March I happened to watch a Joseph Alai's video and he was talking about Neville. It was my first time hearing about him. Without expectations I tested it immediately and followed his instructions on SATS. I did it about 3 times and then forgot about it. In the meanwhile I was imagining 'small' stuff like getting free french fries, beers, coffee ecc.. and got them all! I was surprised but still thought they would have happened anyway.

After about 10 days a bridge of incidents unfolded in a crazy way and what I had imagined became reality. I didn't realize it until the very end.

I had no idea what a mental diet was back then and I messed up completely what I had created.

I gave it another try one month later and things with that sp started evolving again in a crazy way. But again, my mental diet was not good. For some reasons (my inner talk was terrible and my core beliefs were... well.. you can imagine!) I stopped doing SATS because I thought it made me feel more obsessed on my sp. At some point, since I was feeling miserable, full of fears, doubts and all the worst stuff.., he called me and told me out of the blue he couldn't come to visit me because he was going on a date with a girl. I started reacting very badly and thinking this law thing didn't exist, it only made me feel worse, he had never loved me and bla bla bla bla bla

When I kinda recovered from this breakdown I kept reading stuff on this sub about the law. What I hadn't understood back then was the fact I had to fix my damn mental diet first.   
Me and my sp got close again for some reasons and decided to go on a long trip together. Before leaving, my (obsessive) thought was "What if he meets another girl and falls for her?" I was full of fears and doubts, and I had no idea what self love was. 

What happened during that trip? Exactly what I had feared and I reacted in the worst way possible. I tried to change my reality by reacting but I ended up creating an even worse situation. I felt miserable and I was forced on being there for 1 month.   
Even though this is not a happy manifestation, it's still a manifestation success! The law worked perfectly even that time!

When I finally came back home I was devastated, but after a week or two I found the strength to get up and get my power back. I started working on myself in a serious way. At first it was so hard, I wanted to give up but my determination was too strong.   
In September I had finally understood I had to put myself on the pedestal, not another person. 

At some point I started feeling so much better. I kept testing the law keeping a journal and from September till now I manifested several things: money, free pizza, people I haven't seen in months or years, kisses, texts, compliments, calls ecc..

But I was still looking for results regarding my 'big desire' and also I was being influenced by what I was seeing on social medias. My mental diet wasn't on point yet. At some point I won a free coaching session with bryguy (another manifestation) and he suggested me to avoid any situation where I could’ve met him and to get off social medias. So I did! I stopped using any social media (except reddit once in a while) and you have no idea how good I feel now. I absolutely have no idea what he is doing and I don't obsess whether or not he sees my 'stories' or not. I've been reading Neville's books and everything is clearer now. I'm happy because I'm developing self-love and understanding my real power. I still have to deal with some limiting beliefs but I'm slowly getting rid of them. :)

I have to say that going through all of this with my manifesting mate (who was/is living my same struggles) has helped me a lot. I met her here in August and she is wonderful &lt;3 Thank you, Yuriko. 

Some of my crazy recent manifestations: 

\- I was thinking of a teacher I had in high school and the following day I met her (It has never happened in 6 years)

\-I was at a party and he (my sp) was there as well and I started feeling uncomfortable, at some point I even started thinking of some excuses to go in his direction, but I regained control immediately and thought "i'm a goddess! I don't have to chase anybody" and he ended up coming to me after a while. 

\-I was walking with a friend and I thought "What if I see him?", I forgot about it and after 10 mins I bumped into him. 

\-In May I met a girl at an event and I have never seen her again (even though we live in a small town), I was thinking about her and a few days later she ran towards me while I was walking "heyyy do you remember me???"

\-I have a foreign friend who lives in the university campus, I was in a pub on Saturday and thought "What if she comes here this evening?" but then I remembered this pub is completely on the other side of the town and you need to use a car to go there. After about 10 mins a guy comes to me and says "I don't know you, you don't know me, but I know you are a friend of N(my foreign friend) and she's here now" I was shocked. 

Hope this is gonna help someone :) I'm going to share more success stories soon.

My sp didn't even want to say 'hello' one month ago, but recently he called me, we bumped into each other a few times and we spent some time together. 

My next success story will be about how we got in a healthy committed relationship with each other. :)
Somebody propably already had this idea, if so feel free to donvote

So recently I had this idea of an italian Fiddle Skin, These are the ideas I've come up with:

W: Fiddlesticks starts slurping Spaghetti from his opponent

E: Fiddlesticks throws a pizza (mabye too much similarities to pizza delivery Sivir)

R: The area around Fiddlesticks is a giant Pizza, and around him there are Pizza ingredients (e.g. Salami, Basil, cheese) which fly all over the place

For the character design I had'nt got any original ideas, maybe he also exists of Pasta and wears typical italian clothes?

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you think of it, I didn't spend much time on it :)

 It's another year and my third post of Infrastructure you can add to your Demon the Descent game. Comments and criticism are appreciated. Hopefully this will inspire some people with their God-Machine storylines.

The theme I was going for this round was r/nosleep and CreepyPasta stories. Though I've added a few that don't fall into that category.  Please let me know what you think.

Previous rounds of Infrastructure:

* [Round 1](https://amp.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/6zh7pl/dtd_14_examples_of_infrastructure_all_categories/) \- 14 Infrastructures.
* [Round 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/8pq4ku/dtd_17_examples_of_infrastructure/)\- 17 Infrastructures.

# Concealment Infrastructure:

\&gt;Means to hide an operation from outsiders. Some Concealment Infrastructures are mundane, like a fake restaurant to keep mortals from exploring the basement; others are supernatural, which likely explains why so few beings have a clue of the existence of the Machine.

## Static Channel

The dead channel full of static. Those who watch it begin seeing strange things. Some say monsters live inside the static.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

The static channel is used concealing video messages, angels, and cryptids. It is a bolthole type pocket dimension to keep things hidden. This dimension can take whatever form the God-machine and his servants want. Including television programs acted by simulacrum.

\*Security:\*

The channel is usually tied to only one TV, but sometimes two or more TVs can access the same static channel. Once inside the static channel the only way out is for the TV to still be on. Turning it off or switching channels will break the link. The connection can be reestablished if the TV is turned back on and sent to the same channel.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When tuned in the TV will give off Aether as white light..

\*Linchpin:\*

Smashing the TV’s screen will destroy the static channel. Once all TV’s connected to the channel are destroyed the static channel and everything inside it will be destroyed.

## Doorway to Hell

Over the world there have been reports of “Doorways to Hell”. These typically are doors that mysteriously show up in impossible locations or have an aura of evil surrounding it.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

The doorway acts as bolthole for the God-Machine’s inner workings. 

\*Security:\*

Each door has a key that is bound to it, typically in the possession of an Angel or Stigmatic. Any attempt to open the door without a key will result in the door staying in the closed state. Mortals who get feelings of discomfort as they get closer to the door.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The keyhole will give off small amounts of Aether while closed.

\*Linchpin:\*

Shimmying a specific type of store loyalty card to jimmy the lock will deactivate the effect. The door will become a normal door, but what it’s hiding will no longer be securely hidden. The door can be shut, but mortals will be able to open it from now on.

## Emergency Announcement

With the increase in cellphone use, emergency services have the ability to notify anyone with a phone about an emergency. The perfect way to keep people off the street.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

All cellphones within a certain radius receive an emergency alert on their phone telling them to stay inside due to inclimate weather. For the duration of the message all mortals will stay inside, allowing agents of the God-Machine to work unseen. Demons are unaffected, allowing Angels to use this to help track the Unchained. If used for too long mortals will eventually run out of food and die.

\*Security:\*

The emergency announcement system is typically in the form of a laptop attached to an antenna of some kind to transmit the message. A Messenger Angel typically operates the device and keeps it close by.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The antenna or cell tower will emit Aether for as long as the emergency is in effect. 

\*Linchpin:\*

Calling 911 on an affected phone will break the affect and disable the system permanently. It is an emergency failsafe. 

## Mystery Spot

The God-Machine’s matrices sometimes cause physics to take a lunch break. Such anomalies cause people to question why. Hence the Mystery Spot attraction, tourists come to see a cheesy tourist trap that distracts from the severity of the problem.

\*Type:\*

Concealment

\*Function:\*

The Mystery Spot is setup and run by a bored looking Simulacra that will charge people money to see “an unexplainable phenomenon”. Mortals are typically turned off by the idea, but those that aren’t believe it is an illusion. A fair few will be turned into Stigmatics by witnessing the inner workings of the God-Machine, but the Mystery Spot is designed to minimize such occurrences. 

\*Security:\*

Mystery Spots don’t have a lot of security. The simulacra doesn’t attack anyone who looks too closely, but will direct stigmatics to a “friend” who will explain what happened if it detects one is created.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

A broken ticket machine will expel aether at regular intervals since the infrastructure is always running.

\*Linchpin:\*

Spot Remover

# Defense Infrastructure:

\&gt;Means to protect an operation once it has been discovered. Again, the means of protection can vary: Sometimes, it is an ambush set up by the resident gang that have been informed by an anonymous source; at other times, it is a Destroyer Angel equipped with a flaming sword.

## Ear Piercing Alarm

In order to keep equipment secure security systems are embedded into vehicles and houses. The God-Machine has turned the volume to 11 to create a sonic weapon that will kill any person who tries to break in.

\*Type:\*

Defense

\*Function:\*

If lock is bypassed without proper clearance (i.e. key, badge, or passcode) the alarm will go off and cause massive injury to any being with working eardrums. The alarm is localized to the infrastructure it is protecting.

\*Security:\*

The alarm can be bypassed with the proper key, badge, or passcode depending on how it is configured. 

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Aether is released after any unauthorized lifeforms within its functional area are eliminated. This process occurs because it is trying to replenish its energy after its sonic attack.

\*Linchpin:\*

Plugging the speaker with earplugs.

## Elf on a Shelf

A toy elf that sits on a shelf and also reports any unusual behavior to the God-Machine. It knows when you’ve been good and it knows when you’ve interfered with its plans for the last time.

\*Type:\*

Defense

\*Function:\*

The toy elf is a Yuletide tradition that has a relatively new history. The God-Machine has bypassed the toy’s reporting to Santa Claus and is able to get minute to minute reports from the inanimate elf. The elf will report all information to the God-Machine’s agents. Typically an Angel with a Santa Claus cover. This is beneficial in surveillance and security situations..

\*Security:\*

The elf on the shelf can be remotely controlled to attack targets deemed threats to what it is watching over.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When the Elf uploads data to the God-Machine it excretes pine scented aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

Knocking the elf prone will cause it to break.

## Neighborhood Watch

When the police can’t be bothered the neighborhood watch is there to keep an eye out for trouble.

\*Type:\*

Defense

\*Function:\*

The neighborhood watch is a group of humans compelled to defend their street from “undesirables”. The members typically are able to rapidly communicate with one another as if via telepathy. Many are armed with weapons that are more akin to a private military than a group of PTA members.

\*Security:\*

If the group cannot contain the problem they will call the police, which may include stigmatics and an angel depending on the strategic value of the area being defended.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The sewer under the street contain aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

If the Neighborhood Watch sign is removed the residents will return to normal and not interfere with strangers entering their area.

## Deadly Curse

The deadly curse trope has been common in mummy fiction. The God-Machine took this idea and spun it around. This infrastructure is hidden within another piece of infrastructure. If someone without authorization tries to stop the occult matrix the curse will activate.

\*Type:\*

Defense

\*Function:\*

The curse comes in the form of a runic tattoo that is tied to the person who triggered it. This tattoo is persistent even when changing covers or in demon form. The curse itself will act as a beacon for angels as well as increase bad luck for the individual.

\*Security:\*

The curse is a parasite that latches onto a host. It acts as a red flag for the God-Machine to track as well as cause misforturne to the target. No mortal tattoo removal can permanently get rid of it.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The upside of the tattoo is that it is a portable aether store, giving the target either regenerating aether or aether storage if they are not a demon.

\*Linchpin:\*

The tattoo cannot be removed, but can be modified. If the target gets a tattoo over it the curse is removed.

# Logistical Infrastructure:

Means to locate, collect, and transport the equipment necessary for generating Output. Depending on the operation, these Infrastructures can vary a great deal, from ordinary metal gears to an ancient relic of a forgotten civilization.

## The House on the Hill

The history of the house is full of ghost stories and mysterious deaths.

\*Type:\*

Logistical

\*Function:\*

The house itself is infrastructure designed to create ghosts so that the God-Machine can repurpose the energy for its own use. Humans who live in the house will start be driven mad as the house sucks their lifeforce and sanity. 

\*Security:\*

The house becomes an anchor for multiple ghosts. These ghosts typically will defend the house to avoid being destroyed. The house can defend itself by causing hallucinations and sending out ghosts it nows will be able to protect it.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When a person dies inside the house a burst of aether from the chimney as the house converts the living energy into a ghost.

\*Linchpin:\*

The heart of the house is a single room covered in black mold. A fire inside that room will destroy the house and destroy any ghosts anchored to it. Getting to the room is nearly impossible as the house can divert sense those who wish to harm it.

## The Waiting Package

Often times a package is delivered and it waits... and waits. Never being picked up and never being delivered.

\*Type:\*

Logistical

\*Function:\*

The package is left outside of a house, but no one ever picks it up. At least no one who lives in the house. It is designed to be stolen. A thief searching for delivered packages will grab the box and take it to where they live. When the box is opened the thief will be exposed to the God-Machine’s inner workings, becoming a stigmatic. They will then leave the box outside their house for another thief to find and leave to join the God-Machine’s agents. 

\*Security:\*

The package is a brown cardboard box with a shipping label. The destination will always update to where it is left. Any attempt to destroy the package will cause it to return to where it was found.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When the box is opened aether is emitted. 

\*Linchpin:\*

Writing return to sender on the package will deactivate all infrastructure within it. Leaving behind an empty box.

## Family Entertainment Center

An arcade and pizza joint all in one. In the morning it is entertainment for the entire family, but being perceptive might peel back the facade. An Urban Legend states that the animatronics walk after dark looking for new playmates.

\*Type:\*

Logistical

\*Function:\*

The Family Entertainment Center is a facade that is used to create animatronic golems. These creatures are humans whose souls are bound into robotic shells. Typically those who accidentally stay past closing are the victims. These individuals are non-stigmatic workers or investigators that are allowed in by the God-Machine’s minions.

\*Security:\*

Stigmatics run the daily operations of the infrastructure. A Psychopomp leads them in making sure the concealment infrastructure is maintained and that newly made animatronics are shipped where they need to go. At night anyone inside will be unable to leave until the morning. The animatronics do not discriminate between Angel, Demon, or Mortal. They are only passive to other animatronics and children.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When a soul is anchored to an animatronic the pizza oven expels aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

A new animatronic must be created every seven days, if this does not occur the infrastructure will collapse from under use.

## Delivery Application

Need something delivered in an instant? Try the latest courier application. Get any item delivered to you no questions asked.

\*Type:\*

Logistical

\*Function:\*

The God-Machine has found the Gig Economy a simple way to supply the Angel on the go. Mortal drivers have packages containing various illegal and supernatural items. Many drivers are either mortals, stigmatics, or simulacra.

\*Security:\*

Packages are guarded by their courier, but the main security is the packaging. Packages are surrounded by “cardboard” that protects its contents from interaction with the outside world. The only person who can open the package is whoever’s name is marked as the recipient.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Phones using the app to request or navigate a delivery give off aether..

\*Linchpin:\*

Giving the application a non-5 star review on the app store will cause the application to be deleted.

# Elimination Infrastructure:

Means to eliminate all evidence once the desired result is achieved. The method of elimination can be as crude as acts of arson or demolitions or as subtle as a loyal wizard or spirit that causes the entire town to forget.

## Empty Grave

A six foot deep hole that is completely empty. Near it is a blank headstone.

\*Type:\*

Elimination

\*Function:\*

When a person enters the hole it begins to fill with dirt, burying the victim alive. Once the hole is completely filled the victim’s information fills the headstone.

\*Security:\*

None. Not even a railing. 

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The earth around the hole excretes aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

Placing a pepperoni pizza on the tombstone will destroy the empty grave and the victim will return to the surface. Note that the victim may have died from suffocate in the intervening time.

## Vintage Video Game

No one knows exactly why the video game was created, but what is known is that those who play it die in horrible ways. The video game on a form of media, such as a DVD or cartridge.

\*Type:\*

Elimination

\*Function:\*

When a player starts the game their mind will begin to deteriorate until they become comatose, die, or their mind is so damaged that they become insane.

\*Security:\*

The game media itself cannot be physically destroyed. Any attempt will result in the video game appearing inside the next compatible console/computer that the person who destroyed it uses. Additionally after the video game finishes off a player it will be sold off by the player’s family in an estate sale.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When the computer or console playing the game its power supply will give off aether.

\*Linchpin:\*

Exposing the game media to a magnet will erase all game data. 

## Collectible Card Game

When a person becomes too curious or obsessed the God-Machine introduces them to a compulsion to keep their attention away from its inner workings. And thus the “Angels and Demons: Trading Card Game” was created.

\*Type:\*

Elimination

\*Function:\*

The appearance of the cards are simple thick paper cards with fantasy artwork. In actuality the cards have an addictive “got to collect them all” coating them. Anyone who opens a booster pack full of these cards is at risk to become obsessed, spending all their money to become “the best”. Victims have been known to destroy their entire life and bank accounts in order to get more and more cards.

\*Security:\*

The card game is for kids ages 12 and up. 

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The cards in the discard pile produce aether whenever a game is played.

\*Linchpin:\*

The card game loses its hold over a person if every card the collector owns is shredded.

## Haunted Jewelry

Sometimes a person needs to have the fear of the God-Machine put into them. The God-Machine needs to eliminate a target by making them too scared to act. Thus this infrastructure will create “ghosts” to haunt a target until they are too scared to function.

\*Type:\*

Elimination

\*Function:\*

The actual infrastructure is an innocuous object such as a piece of jewelry. A victim will find themselves haunted by the ghosts of those they knew who died. The ghosts are not traditional ghosts and in fact are more akin to spirits than actual ghosts, but their forms have been overwritten by the God-Machine. These “ghosts” will try to tear away at the victim’s sanity, if that doesn’t work they will resort to murder.

\*Security:\*

Normal mortals won’t recognize the danger of the jewelry, unless someone points out that all the haunting started when they started wearing the jewelry. If someone tries to remove the jewelry with the intent to stop the haunting, the jewelry will constrict until it is impossible to remove. Further tampering could result in the jewelry strangling or cutting off circulation to the limb its attached to.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

When a haunting is occurring the jewelry will emit aether. 

\*Linchpin:\*

Causing the metal of the jewelry to be tarnished will cause the jewelry to fall apart and lose its properties.

# Command and Control:

The central unit that directs the operation and coordinates the various factors that eventually lead to the creation of the matrix. A Command and Control Infrastructure has never been observed, but there are rumors among the Unchained that by altering one of these Infrastructures, the plans of the God-Machine can be severely set back.

## Think Tank

The God-Machine knows how dangerous it can be to give one person complete power. Thus the Think Tank was created, a group of individuals who can act as checks and balances for its Occult Matrix. The individuals don’t know how their decisions are carried out, but they will be given a goal and figure out what needs to happen to reach it. Perhaps a politician needs to be replaced, the Think Tank members tell an Angel who will then designate the proper course of action. Either by killing the individual literally or setting dominos in motion to destroy the politician’s career.

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

The Think Tank consists of four members. Each member is significantly different than the others and all four need to be present within the Think Tank building for the Command and Control Infrastructure to operate. The members can be replaced if the stress of the Infrastructure causes them too much stress or if they go rogue, usually this results in a trip to a God-Machine controlled psych ward. The building is the housing unit of the Infrastructure, but the humans are like the computer RAM. 

When the people have consensus on an issue a Messenger Angel will take their decision and then delegate the task to other agents of the God-Machine. 

\*Security:\*

The Security team is run by Stigmatics and Angels who are prepared to evacuate the building at the first signs of infiltration.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The Think Tank’s generates so much aether that it is disposed via the city’s sewage line.

\*Linchpin:\*

Killing a member of the Think Tank while it is in session will cause a cascading failure throughout the Infrastructure, making it completely inoperable. It took decades to get the Think Tank Infrastructure working, and will take decades for the Angels to rebuild it.

## The Four Prophecies

This Command and Control Infrastructure is based on communicating with various spirits. Any message that is delivered four times in the exact phrasing is considered a confirmed God-Machine edict.

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

The key pieces of the Infrastructure are a ouija board, a deck of tarot cards, crystal ball, and tea leaves. On their own these items would be too mundane to get anything close to the God-Machine’s messages. But when given to clairvoyant humans the Infrastructure is active. None of the humans know the true purpose of these messages, but the angels have agents observing these people and reporting what is said.

\*Security:\*

Each psychic is separated from one another and has a frequent customer who is in fact an agent of the God-Machine. 

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

Whenever the prophecy is repeated for the fourth and last time, aether is expelled from the items.

\*Linchpin:\*

Killing a psychic will not end the Infrastructure, the Angels can just give the devices to other psychics. The Infrastructure can be disrupted if one of the devices is stolen, but could result in the Angels relying on prophecies that are repeated 3 times instead of 4. To completely destroy the Infrastructure all four items must be in the same location.

## Bistro-Mathmatics

Douglas Adams once wrote a book that posited that restaurant bills do not follow the laws of mathematics. The God-Machine realized this as well and created the Bistro-Mathmatics engine, a restaurant that could calculate the proper course of action to take.

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

The restaurant is a high scale bistro with customers who always seem to be busy in conversation. The staff as well as busy with their work. However, the owner looks out to the bistro and sees the workings of the God-Machine, taking notes and sending them to the God-Machine’s agents in order to carry out the God-Machine’s will. All who are trapped in the bistro’s calculations are forever stuck in place, unable to leave. If a person dies they are replaced with a new guest.

\*Security:\*

All of the restaurant guests are mortals, but the staff are stigmatics or simulacra who will try to remove those who aren’t on the guest list. The restaurant’s guest list is always full and they do not take reservations.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The dumpster outside the restaurant is full of aether and gets cleaned out on a weekly basis.

\*Linchpin:\*

Replacing the health inspection sign from an A to an F will result in the restaurant being flooded with rats, causing all the guests to leave and dismantling the Infrastructure completely.

## Blood Stone Circle

The Blood Stone Circle was created by the God-Machine to interpret it’s will in remote areas. The stones are covered in ancient writing and sometimes sprout cults around them.

\*Type:\*

Command and Control.

\*Function:\*

The Blood Stone Circle can be as big as the God-Machine wills it. The only stipulation is that they have to be equidistant from one another. Human blood must be spilled on each stone pillar simultaneously in order to receive the command of the God-Machine. The ancient rituals that cultists perform are not necessary, one pint of animal blood smeared on the stone will suffice. But that doesn’t stop cults from performing virgin sacrifices to the dark gods on them.

\*Security:\*

The stone pillars are easily hidden and in some cases stigmatic cults form around them. Cultists will protect the stone pillars from any harm. Angels will sometimes become cult figure heads in order to keep a close eye.

\*Waste Aether Disposal Line:\*

The Blood Stone Circle creates a pool of aether in the center of the circle. 

\*Linchpin:\*

If holy water is sprinkled on each stone pillar simultaneously the pillars will crumble.


I know I'm going to sound like an angry boomer in this post (I'm actually gen z) but really nobody else gets it but you guys. So anyway, I ordered a pizza online from a place I've never ordered from before (minsky's), and when it arrived, I stupidly didn't check it right away to make sure they got it right. This was an expensive pizza too, I decided to splurge even though I knew that I'm tight on money right now. So, obviously, theres cheese on it. I called the pizza place and asked if theres any way I can get a refund or if I could trade it out because of course I don't want to pay for this cheese, but they tell me no because it's my fault they put cheese on it. Apparently, at this pizza place when you order online you can't just not click on a cheese option, you have to actually click "no cheese" or they'll just put cheese on it anyway. This makes no sense to me because I did the same thing with the meat and they didn't put any meat on it. Anyway, so they said that they gave me what I ordered and that they cant do anything about it. He offered to give me a $5 coupon and that's it. I was so upset, but I didn't get angry with him, instead I just hung up and gave the pizza to my roomates. They were sympathetic but of course they joked about how it's already made and I might as as well eat it and maybe I could pick the cheese off. I know this was my fault (even though they had a very poor website design) but I'm still upset because I spent $25 i could barely afford on a pizza I didn't even eat.

So first and foremost, I just got my letter of approval from insurance!  Surgery is set for November 18th - super excited, super nervous.

I've always been a big dude.  Not always fat, but always big.  I think the kids use Thicccccc.  I played football in high school which lead to a multitude of injuries including both my knees being basically useless.  Before those injuries I was a well oiled machine of weight lifting, eating, and playing football.  After the injuries, I kept going with eating, but not so much the working out or active lifestyle.  Over the last 10 or so years I have balloned up to around 430 lbs.   I have a one year old and a baby on the way in February and I will not leave my kids without a daddy because I like eating pizza.

So I contacted Garden State Bariatrics and made the first appointment.  I was beyond impressed by the office and the doctor.  I met with the surgical coordinator who gave me my homework to get approval.  This included:

* A psychological evaluation
* A cardiological workup (stress test, EKG, overall health)
* A workup from my PCP and recommendation
* Blood work, blood work, and more blood work
* 2 meetings with the in-office nutrionalist  

Oddly enough, I had no weight loss goals, no classes, nothing like that.  I also do not have a pre-surgery diet, only have to be on liquids for 1 day before.

I am a smoker, been cutting down but do not get tested or anything like that.  My plan is to just not smoke when i get out of the hospital.

I plan on taking measurements the day before I go in and will update as I progress.

Totally excited and cant wait to join the losers bench.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Fat guy got approved for surgery.
Dear members, newcomers and (long-time) lurkers

Six months ago, r/neapolitanpizza was brought to life in hope to create a place for people who are as enthusiastic about Neapolitan pizza as we are.

The last two days our sub has grown and even made it to the trending page today.

At this point, we want to thank all of our members who made this possible! We also want to heartily welcome every new member and we hope that you will like it here!

Thanks again to everyone! :)


Heya! I'm Jayme. Currently waiting for the slowest Dominos delivery driver in existence to bring me my food so hey, what a better time to make a new friend!

It's my birthday, turning 22 today. Weird to type it out. I'm from Ireland and I work in I.T for the Irish government. I have hobbies and interests in a bit of everything, from psychology to fashion to history to photography. Whatever interests me on the day! I also suck at typing about myself but I love to learn about other people and their walks of lives. It's fascinating to me.

PM me your top 3 pizza toppings!

I think it might be time for me to pick one up.  I’m a musician so I work in the evening downtown, once recently I got out a gig and my car was covered in pizza and had some scratches that needed repair, so a parking mode that continues to take video (or pictures at a slower rate) would be nice.. something that doesn’t need to be triggered by an impact.  I’d also like to hardwire it in so there isn’t wires everywhere in my new car (though maybe that is a requirement anyway for parking mode), and the camera itself should be as small as possible.  The picture should at least be good enough that you can see license plates...

Having a rear cam would be nice too, but not required.   

The last possible difficulty with hardwiring/parking mode is that my car is a plug in hybrid (a cross between an electric car and a hybrid, it plugs in and can drive the first 47km on battery, then the gas engine turns on and it drives like a hybrid).  Like other hybrids/electrics there’s the high voltage batteries that it uses to drive, and a small 12v battery.  The 12v is smaller than one in a standard gas engine car, so maybe that will be an issue for the parking mode.. the car does automatically charge it from the high voltage batteries when it gets low though, so maybe it will be ok, but then that means there’s no protection for if the high voltage battery runs out. I know that many dash cams with parking mode will automatically shut down if the power gets low enough, but in my car that won’t happen, the car will just keep recharging that battery using the driving battery until that’s empty, and then I’ll be unable to start the car.  Anyone else have a parking mode dash cam with this type of car?   Or should I just forget about parking mode.  My car doesn’t even let me listen to the radio without it being ‘on’ (using the high voltage batteries) - after a minute or so the screen displays a warning about the possibility of battery discharge and then the screen turns off.

Edit: I should note, I’m totally fine with one that has wifi and no screen.  The smaller the better as long as the picture quality is ok.

I went completely NC. Cut all his profiles off. All the NC gave me a lot of clarity. He never wanted to be a stepdad, he blamed me for everything he did wrong, he made me pay for everything. Sex was the only thing keeping me there and being Scared of being alone. 

I met a guy. He is taking me out Saturday. He writes me good morning texts and gives me butterflies. We are going to have pizza and a Rick and Morty marathon. 

I did it. I'm staying subbed just so I know to never look back. Thank you guys for everything.
Anyone here from the Ypsi - Ann Arbor area? If anyone is do we want to get together and phone bank? Yang still needs two qualifying polls and as Barack Obama once said,  "We shouldn't expect (politics) to be entertaining all the time  ...  "Sometimes you are just in a church basement making phone calls and eating cold pizza." Anyways, if anyone here on this subreddit is in for an evening of phone banking with Yang supporters and friends (if you bring them) let's make a date and make some calls
 I have been underweight for most of my life, to a point where I can't even afford to not eat above 1300 calories for two days due to maybe having a cold or pms and losing my appetite. A week ago I started tracking my calories so I can monitor my daily intake (I try my hardest to eat 1800-2000 calories a day, succsessfully so). It does prove to be a little hard sometimes, mainly because I'm a college student and find it difficult to cook two full meals apart from breakfast a day. So I'm really looking for any advice I can get on the topic of weight gain; meals or high calorie snacks you recommend, protein shakes, something to look out for, your weight gain stories, anything really.

Edit: here's some basic info about my current diet: I mostly have a bowl of oatmeal and milk for breakfast, for lunch and dinner I usually go for either some kind of casserole, pizza, pasta or something with potatos. I have atleast one or two snacks a day. I'm not really the greatest cook, most of the meals within my diet are quickly made due to lazyness and not knowing any better. I barely eat meat, I'm not vegan or vegetarian though, I just dislike it.
I am fructose intolerant, which prevents me from eating and drinking too sugary things or stuff that involves too much fruit,so smoothies or juice are off my list


I am currently making a Five Nights at Freddy's fangame. And since I have decided that lore in games is pretty fucking cool, I decided to have some. Unlike Scott who made everything up as he went along, or other games that are "forced" to make an explanation to its characters and locations I wanted to sit down and firstly write it. And to be unique from other games, I had the idea "What if the storyline had nothing to do with Five Nights at Freddy's?". Absolutely nothing.

It gives me writer freedom, let's me go fully creative and not be condoned to trying to make up a story of a plot-wise REALLY messy franchise, and it has generally not been done before. And another thing: The story would not have the same plot-holes like FNaF does. Five Nights at Freddy's lore is hard to comprehend, but we still know some plotpoints as fact. Things like freely walking animatronics that can detect a criminal from a mile away in 1987 (Which is even more than we have today I believe), Why only the puppet can put souls into animatronics, and so on. This can all be dismissed as world-building, but even then my other points are still valid and I think stories that are easier to believe are scarier. It's still my opinion, but it's still a point.

And the writing process has been pretty good so far! I have some ideas, where it's still a short-ish story about a man who steals for his own success (Or something like that, I don't know). And it has no pizza restaurant, no dead kids, none of the typical FNaF stuff (Except for animatronics, but they are for different entertainment purposes). And I was wondering if that would still count as a Five Nights at Freddy's fangame. The reason that I even question this is because

1. The gameplay will be about surviving animal characters that are portrayed as entertainment animatronics
2. The game will have plenty of references to and easter eggs about Five Nights at Freddy's
3. The game itself will feature things like cameras, an extras menu, a certain amount of nights/levels to survive, etc. just differently (Like many other games do. They also take these cliches and turn them into something unique)

I think that fangames can as a game be like their inspiration, but have a different setting. story, etc. But seeing how basicly every Five Nights at Freddy's fangame has something to do with the franchise itself, it made me question if I'm just making an original fangame, or not even really a fangame.

Please tell me what you think, and why you think that, just like me. I wrote this ass-long text to explain my thought process.


I’ve got an online code for a free medium 2-topping pizza from Domino’s. If you’d like it, put “pizza” somewhere in your comment and one person will be randomly selected. Thanks (: 

Note: code isn’t valid *until* 11/18 and has to be redeemed online for delivery.


I am a stay at home mom to a 1 year old and an almost 3 year old. Since my 3 yr old was born I have dealt with severe mental health problems. PPD and PPA continue to haunt me a year after my youngest was born despite having medication and therapy. Most of the time I do fine but I have days where I just can't do it. I cannot function, I cannot focus, and I'm losing it emotionally all day. Those are also the days where the kids are particularly fussy. Like today, I'm having an extremely hard time and the kids are crying non stop. My husband works a salary, 8-5 IT job, from home. He gets nearly a month of PTO that is not divided by vacation or sick time.

Days like today I need help. I don't have anyone else to help me but my husband. But his boss won't let him take emergency time off. Last time he asked, multiple superiors cussed him out, said I should just get over it and told him to buy a pizza for dinner and I should just be happy that I don't have to cook. Granted, my husband worded it as my being "stressed out" instead of dealing with a mental health crisis.

There was a point where I had an EOD, for my own safety, from the er dr and his boss still wanted him to go to work even though there wouldn't have been anyone who could look after our kids. 

I mean, am I out of line for expecting my husband to be able to take some time off when I desperately need it? Yeah, I'm able to take care of the kids necessities, they are being fed, diapers are being changed, but I am unable to do anymore than that. The kids scream non stop on days like today, I'm unable to figure out what it is that they need beyond feeding them and making sure their diapers are changed, I'm crying and having panic attacks all day, and the fact that I can't ask husband for help so I can catch back up to my illness makes it even harder.

So am I wrong for expecting that my husband should be able to take the occasional day off when I desperately need it?


Estamos arreglando con unos amigos y no nos ponemos de acuerdo a dónde ir, ¿me sugieren alguna idea de lugares por Carrasco?

Ya se nombraron Volcánica, Carrasco beer house y almacén de pizzas.

Gracias!

Okay, so this is something I've been thinking about for a while now. Something that never made sense to me. In the time leading up to Help Wanted, we had been shown the image of many different animatronics fused (or melted) together. It was a piece of imagery that never really fit into the actual game other than it being a bunch of different games in one. Then, I remembered the end of Fnaf 6. In it, the animatronics all go down in a supposedly final blaze of glory, freeing the souls, and ending this chapter. But, what if it didn't?

If you recall, William Afton discovered a kind of 'Soul Matter' called 'Remnant', which allowed him to fuse childrens' souls and inject them into animatronics, like in Candy Cadet's stories. They all involved taking different things and making them one, then putting them into some container. Well, what I'm thinking is that, since he had to melt the remnant to inject it, that means it must be able to stand extreme temperatures. Which brings us to the end of Fnaf 6. They all burn, heating them up to an extreme degree. But, what if all this did was melt the animatronics' souls together? Henry probably wouldn't know anything about remnant, so, if it was him that burned down the pizarrea, then he could have accidentally made all the animatronics one being! 

Think about Glitchtrap. He's a virus uploaded into Help Wanted, possibly through a mess of parts delivered to the game dev's door, and wishes to take control of your mind. But, in the Pizza Party ending, he lures you into the back room in a Golden Bonnie suit, brings you on stage, and puts you into an animatronic. But, why? What could he have to gain from that? Well, what it wasn't Afton, but, instead, it was ALL of the animatronics' souls fused, made into a program, and is now showing you the last thing the originals saw before their Doom? What if they want you to switch places with them, for you to be the one on stage, and for them to be free, dancing? What if the parts that the game devs found were actually the parts that had melted together, including the remnant? My theory is that the children have concocted a plan to take control of your mind through VR. They did it to Tape Girl, who has tricked you into putting him into a plushie, so he could remain safe, while she enacted the plan in a *white rabbit* suit. Anyone else notice how Tape Girl sounds a lot like Reluctant Follower? And, think about it. She doesn't sound all that reluctant. But, what if she had been taken control of by Glitchtrap, and this wasn't actually what she wanted to do? A little off topic, but a nice thought.

Dreadbear is a confusing character. They named a dlc after him, but he does almost nothing! Well, what is Dreadbear, or Frankenstein's Monster, for that matter? They are a bunch of different parts put together into one container. Like the remnant, like Candy Cadet's stories, and like the teaser for the original game. The Parts and Service minigame is symbolic of William's experiments with remnant, his attempts to bring life to an empty vessel, through INJECTING FLUIDS into a brain and putting into Dreadbear. Then, what about Glitchtrap's grave? Well, Im not as sure about it, because it's really hard to tell, but I could see animatronics flashing in his grave. Then, looming over it all, is Dreadbear.

Besides. Golden Freddy had William Afton, and wasn't letting go. He's in Hell, not a Glitchsuit.

Now, I'm not entirely sure on this one. I've put a lot of thought into this though, and I'd be greatful for any feedback. This is my first time coming out with a theory, so I'll be glad to hear what you have to say!
Everyone rants and raves about pizza here but I haven’t tried a single place that I would rate as anything better than fair. The sauce is always bland with no life, no flavor, the cheese is rubbery plastic, bread is dry cardboard. I’m not saying there’s no great pizza out there, but everything I’ve tried is just meh. I was told the pizza here is great, but it is remarkably disappointing.




What are some good videos?

I can only do the pizza. But I can’t french fry at steeper elevation. I’m already getting lessons in-person but they dont start until Dec. Some local resorts already opened for the season, so I don’t want to wait a full month. I figure I’ll hit the beginner hill and try to figure a few things out before
For the past two months, I've noticed that the deep pan bases are now basically stone baked size in thickness, despite still being call Deep pan, my first thought was it was a bad batch but it's now constant, I then thought maybe it was a supplier at my local so tried one in the next city over to my horror it was the exact same there, is this now universal for all asdas? Does deep pan only exist in name only? I asked the staff in my local but they just huffed and said this is all they had. I don't wanna be the person who says 'I want to speak to a manager' for the answer so I'll ask the internet instead



I (16m) have struggled with obesity for most of my life. In my house, money is super tight, and although I'd love to be one of those people who cook all their food from fresh ingredients, we really don't have the money. Consequently, most of the food we get is frozen stuff (Pizza bites, frozen chicken, gross stuff like that.)
I went to the doctor for results of an ultrasound, and I have fatty liver disease, high cholesterol, etc. She basically said "Look, if you don't start losing weight, you're at high risk for diabetes and with your liver, it could kill you." I don't eat in excess, but what I do eat is horrible for me. I've tried countless diets and plans over the years, and none seemed to be effective. How do I make a schedule or exercise routine that ACTUALLY works?
Has anyone been to Incredible Pizza recently that could give me some insight? My bf and I are looking at doing something fun and different this weekend and I found a coupon for a .99 cent buffet with an $18 game card. I’m just not sure if it would be too “kiddish” for two adults or if the $18 will go very far?
ETA: and if you have been, will $18 each last us very long?

I am feeling pretty disappointed. I have been logging my food for 15 days and for the most part keeping at 1200. Even the days when I had pizza and alcohol. I mentioned before that I was bloated and went from 157 to 163 in 3 days and was told that it probably was water weight. 

Fast forward to today - I did have alcohol again over the weekend. I am now at 161, which is great. I'd like to be able to drink on the weekend (even if it's just Friday), indulge in my pizza once a week and still lose weight. Is that even possible? 

I know weight loss isn't linear and it's not fast or overnight. I've also been exercising 5 days a week. I don't know what to do. Last time I tried to lose weight I lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks and now in 2 weeks, I've only lost 2pounds. 

Any tips, encouragement or anything would be appreciated.
I became obsessed with making a friend in one of my classes at school. I was going to approach her today and start a conversation...I got nervous, it didn’t happen, and now I feel like a failure. 

This after WEEKS of not being able to let this go. I would think ALL DAY of this ONE scenario. And it was a freaking bust. I tried to let this go beforehand. But It’s like I don’t know how else to distract myself. No matter what I did, I could not seem to overpower these thoughts. And this is just one of many obsessive thoughts swirling around in my head. I want so bad to reach into my mind and pull the thoughts out myself. 

I’m upset with myself, I’m mad at the world, I don’t want to talk with anyone, I want to cancel work, leave school, hole up in bed, and eat an entire cake and box of pizza. I hate this, I seriously hate this so much. I AM SO TIRED OF THIS!





I remembered a collection of small book we had when we were young that tells a story of animals living in a town. We had it around late 90s as a gift. The books are small and can fit in your pocket. Every pages are quite thick, like what you would expect for any book aimed for toddler. Every page is a whole illustration of beautiful cartoon animals doing work from a part of a town. I can't remember exactly if it came with a bigger package to hold the books in pockets to form a whole town like a map. But I'm pretty sure if you put each books standing in the table you can make a town. 

Each book is also shaped according to what establishment it was. Covers have cuts in them allowing you to see parts of the inner pages. Example, the restaurant (I think titled, "the ducks' place" had a drawing of a restaurant and people eating outside. The book is cut in shape of the restaurant. The main window in the cover is cutout so you can see the duck waitstaff bringing food. Once you open it, the whole inside of restaurant is revealed on both the backside of the cover and the first page making a wider view. Its really cute.

I only remember bits and pieces of the stories and illustrations. There are sailor cat who mops their boat. They wake up early to catch lots of sardines. The duck offers deep dish pizza whom a family of mouse happily eats pulling strands of sticky cheese. Some rabbit drives a bus (or maybe a train? can't remember). I think there are 8 or more of these. Some main characters from each book visits the other books in their stories.

I tried searching google, but since I don't have any specifics, I can't find it over thousands of childrens book featuring animal drawings. After sifting thru several pages, i haven't found anything with similar art style. The closest I think was Busy busy town by Richard Scarry but its rather missing a certain charm compared to the book I'm referring to. I remember each animal have mire details, and effectively captured expressions, and they're poses are much more... humanly.
As the title states. I first discovered this magnificant pairing when I was little and got a "Pizza Treatza," a lunchable that comes with normal pizza making materials, as well as little choclate bits and a fudge sauce for a "treatza." For the heck of it I tried making a pizza with the fudge sauce, pizza sauce, cheese, and choclate bits and it tasted so amazing that I only have them like that if I happen to have one. I am in my 20s and I still buy some and do it on occasion.

Another Combonation I love is a wendy's Chocolate frosty, french fries, and ketchup all at once. Best eay to do it I found is to dip a fry in the frosty and another in ketchup and eat at the same time. Vanilla works too but not as good.

I have yet to try straight up chocolate and ketchup, but I bet it wouldn't be bad. The sweet chocolate with the tangy/"spicy"iness of the ketchup just collides well.

TL;DR: Try a Chocolate Frosty + Ketchup + Fries or Pizza Treatza with everything on one pizza.
So the other night, I got up to use the bathroom. (I had a flashlight) After doing that, I was walking back to my room. Of all the things I had to do at that moment, I flashed my light down the hall. And -much to my surprise- there was a black rabbit-looking thing at the end of it. Right after I flashed my light, it started charging down the hall at me, all the while screaming something. (I think it was "afton") I scrambled to my room, shut the door, and locked it. From what I can remember, the thing had glowing eyes and teeth. (Both white) I can't remember too clearly because of how fast it was moving, but I think it resembled an animatronic and was *glitching.* The following day after this happened, I decided to try and look up this weird thing on the internet. I typed 'black rabbit robot' into the search and got no results on what I was after. (Just some images of black rabbits and robots.) Then I added the word 'afton'. The results this time were almost the same, black rabbits and robots. Only this time there were a few images related to the poem Sweet Afton. Then I saw a picture of a blue robot bunny, and I clicked it. Apparently he was Bonnie from Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. (which was co-founded by a William Afton) I looked into the history of Freddy Fazbear's and found that there were three versions of the same gang from the years 1983, 1987, and 1989 respectively. I looked at images of the 87' group and discovered that Bonnie from this group looked eerily similar to what I saw the previous night. A day or two later, I was looking for some form of social media platform to ask about the thing, which brings me to right now. Has anyone else seen this strange black bunny?

    Travel Expenses

**Flights**

I flew standard economy on Air Canada from O’Hare to Narita, with a layover in Vancouver both directions. My roundtrip total inclusive of taxes/fees/etc was: \*\*$879.54\*\*

**Accomodations**

I decided to stay mostly in hostels, both to save money and hopefully make some friends! I had originally booked one night in a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) as a treat but had to cancel this last minute due to a typhoon hitting pretty hard the week before I arrived. I ended up bouncing around a lot between cities (intentional) and within cities (less intentional) because I originally planned to add an additional day in Tokyo, but switched this to Kyoto day-of.

* Tokyo hostel #1: 3 nights - **$114.22**
* Tokyo hostel #2:1 night, cancelled day of, did not get refund - **$34.45**
* Kyoto hostel #1: 1 night- **$17.41**
* Kyoto hostel #2: 2 nights - **$58.64**
* Osaka hostel: 1 night - **$20.16**
* Tokyo hostel #3: 1 night - **$27.39**

**Total: 272.27**

&amp;#x200B;

**Pre Trip Purchases**

I’m listing these here but won’t include them in the final roundup, because these are all things I needed already and will definitely use again.

&amp;#x200B;

* New hard-side carry-on (the wheels on my my 6 year old Walmart one were going): **$55**
* Packing cubes: **$12.99**
* Portable power bank: **$55.10**

&amp;#x200B;

**A general note:** Japan is a cash-only society. When doing my own budgeting I rely really heavily on credit card records and Personal Capital because my brain is bad, so not having digital or physical receipts for a lot of these transactions means some of them are estimates. Anything where I don’t have the exact amount is indicated with a \~ and any rounding done is always within 100yen / $1 usd, but I wanted to be transparent that my records aren’t cent-perfect. (Anything without a \~ is one where I did record the exact amount.)

&amp;#x200B;

    Friday 10/18

* I came down with a pretty bad cold in the days right before I left, so I treat myself to a Lyft to the airport instead of taking the bus to the blue line: **$28.96**
* At the airport, I buy a USB to USB-C cord because I didn’t realize the power bank I bought didn’t come with one. The Hudson News price is literally quadruple what I’d pay on Amazon, but that’s the idiot tax. I also buy a Cherry Coke Zero: **$36.90**

**Daily total: $65.86**

&amp;#x200B;

    Saturday 10/19  

* I land in Narita around 4pm local time, at what feels like 2am body time. It’s rough. I buy a SIM card with 14 days of pre-paid unlimited data, and install it myself. All prices from now on are in yen and converted to USD: **$51.32**
* I buy a ticket for the express train into the city: **$29.78**
* I also buy a green tea from a vending machine: **$1.28**
* I ALSO pick up a refillable Suica card (contactless refillable train pass). I put $9.17 on it, but don’t use it yet; I’ll note train fares as I use them.
* After I check in at my hostel in Shibuya, I go to a ramen place down the street and get an extremely delicious bowl of tsukumen ramen. **$9.16**

**Daily total: $91.54**

&amp;#x200B;

    Sunday 10/20  

* Wake up in the middle of the night because jet-lag is a bitch. Wait until it’s almost a decent hour, then go to 7-11 to withdraw some cash and get food. I buy a mandarin orange yogurt, some prepackaged pancakes with syrup, and a bottled iced coffee for around: \*\*\~$3.66\*\*
* I intentionally didn’t bring a lot of my toiletries because I knew I wanted to buy some in Japan, so I go to Don Quijote to pick some up. I buy BB cream, mascara, an eyeshadow single, makeup remover/face wash, sunscreen, a solid perfume stick, and nail polish: \*\*\~$54.97\*\*
* I go to yoyogi park and walk through and it’s absolutely beautiful and serene. Orange tea from vending machine: \*\*$1.19\*\*
* After the park, I go to Meiji Shrine, which is also beautiful and serene. After this, I go to Harajuku and walk around the main shopping streets, which are crazy and overwhelming. I stop and get pork katsu curry for lunch: \*\*$9.89\*\*
* After this, I take the train to Shimokitazawa: \*\*$2.51\*\*
* In Shimokitazawa, I get a latte called “the Dirty” from Bear Pond Espresso and it is literally the best coffee anything I have ever had in my entire life. \*\*5.31\*\*
* I wander around thrift shopping for a while. I love browsing the racks and seeing how different the styles are, but I’m 5’7 and a US 8/10 which means literally nothing here comes close to fitting. I do manage to find a cool oversized denim jacket though, which has been on my list to find for AGES now: \*\*$22.07\*\*
*  I am now extremely tired so I buy a flat white from a different coffee shop. It’s good, but nowhere near as good as the other drink I had: \*\*$4.21\*\*
*  I take the train back to my hostel, where I lay down and rest for around an hour, but I don’t let myself fall asleep just yet \*\*$1.65\*\*
* Then I’m going to Seirinkan, a pizza place that’s supposed to be absolutely legendary…and it is. I get a Margherita pizza that is absolutely some of the best pizza I have ever had. I’m very sad I can’t finish it but it’s an entire pizza and I am only one woman. I also get an Aperol spritz. \*\*$20.81\*\*
* I take the train one stop to a cool bar I found online: \*\*$1.26\*\*
* The bar is called Bar Martha and it’s a super cool vibe; they have a huge sound system and someone playing classic rock songs on vinyl. I get two absolutely fantastic Moscow mules made with fresh ginger and listen to some Beatles deep cuts: \*\*$22.92\*\*
* I walk back to the hostel and pass out the instant my head hits the pillow.

**Daily total: $150.45**

&amp;#x200B;

    Monday 10/21

* Jet lag strikes again. I get an iced latte from a coffee stand on the way to the train station: \*\*$4.49\*\*
* Take the train to the Tsukiji Outer Fish Market (even with jet lag, I was NOT up to the 3am tuna auction): \*\*\~$1.83\*\*
* I get easily overwhelmed/anxious in heavy crowds, so at the fish market I do an initial pass through and then end up on a side street, where it’s a little easier to breathe. I get a pan au chocolat: \*\*$1.83\*\*
*  Now that my blood sugar is up a little, I’m ready. Once more unto the breach and I get octopus on a stick (FANTASTIC): \*\*$4.12\*\*
* Eel on a stick: \*\*$1.83\*\*
* The best iced matcha latte I’ve ever had: \*\*$4.58\*\*
* Done with the fish market, I walk over to Hamarikyu Gardens. They’re absolutely beautiful even in the off-season between summer and fall, where the flowers are dead but the trees are green. Admission: \*\*$2.75\*\*After the gardens, I walk across the river to TeamLab Planets (this walk takes like 45 minutes and is much more industrial than it looked on google maps oops). I pre-bought my ticket online, so I only had to wait in line for less than ten minutes. The exhibition experience was SO cool, especially the room where I was in water up to my knees and could interact with the koi holograms. \*\*$29.54\*\*
*  I take the train back to Ginza vs walking this time. No contest. \*\*$3.56\*\*
* To feed my caffeine addiction, I go to this classic/historic Japanese style coffee house and get a tiny brewed cup of some fancy single-origin dark roast. It was delicious but it was not worth the: \*\*$8.25\*\*
* I have some time to kill before my dinner reservation so I stop at Uniqlo. I can technically fit into the L/XL but they don’t quite hang right, and I know the Japanese style for loose, calf-length skirts isn’t going to play super well back home so I don’t buy anything.
* My dinner reservation is at a place I found in an Eater article for a full sushi omakase experience. Most of the sushi is incredibly delicious, but some of it is really not my thing and I have no clue what I’m actually eating because it’s in Japanese. I also learned later via google that my absolute favorite bite of the evening turned out to be ………..fish sperm. Great. \*\*$60.50\*\*
* I then go to this amazing bar called Bar Orchard. You pick a seasonal fruit out of a pile they have, and then they turn it into a custom cocktail for you, and serve it in really creative ways. I get a sour pear gin cocktail that’s served in a little bathtub, complete with edible sea salt bubbles and rubber duck, and then later I get a pomegranate rum cocktail in a little ziplock bag printed like a mason jam jar. I made some friends and their drinks included: a plum old fashioned where they set a pine cone on fire, something served in a tiny plastic trash can, something involving absinthe they drank out of a watering can. VERY gimmicky, very fun, very delicious. \*\*$47.67\*\*
* I take the train back to my hostel. After I get off at the station, I’m pausing to make sure I’m going the right way and a guy comes up to me and offers to buy me a drink in exchange for practicing his English. OBVIOUSLY my internal common sense radar is saying not to do this, but every single person I talked to said this happens a lot in Japan and is not creepy or weird, and I’m pretty drunk already, so I agree. He was already being kind of persistent and following me down the street so like an IDIOT I thought maybe if I had one drink this would get rid of him. This was obviously a mistake; I end up having to invent a boyfriend (his name is Alex he’s a vet student we’re very happy etc) and walk twenty minutes out of my way before he left me alone and I finally felt safe enough to actually go to my real hostel location. Trust your instincts, guys (although yeah this one was………I don’t know what I was thinking). \*\*$1.82\*\* for the train; the rest cost only my dignity.

**Daily Total: $172.77**

&amp;#x200B;

    Tuesday 10/22  

* I finally (FINALLY) sleep later than 3am. 9:30 baby!!!!! Despite being much better rested, I’m feeling kind of anxious and gross and overwhelmed by Tokyo, so I make the last-minute decision I mentioned earlier to go to Kyoto a day early. The hostel I already booked is full, but one relatively nearby is cheap and free so I make the reservation (price noted above) and check out.
* I get the fluffy Instagram pancakes from Flipper. I thought they would be overrated but they are truly soooooo good. I also get a coffee. \*\*$13.75\*\*
* I take the train to the main Shinkansen connection: \*\*$1.72\*\*
* Once there, I get a Shinkansen ticket to Kyoto: \*\*$129.79\*\*
* Vending machine green tea: \*\*1.47\*\*
* Once I arrive in Kyoto, I buy a vending machine lemon soda: \*\*$1.28\*\*
* Then I walk over to my hostel and check in. The walk is beautiful and really peaceful as I cross the river, and I’m immediately super glad that I came to Kyoto early instead of sticking it out in Tokyo. Once at my hostel, I’m charged an additional tax on top of what I prepaid online. \*\*$1.83\*\*
* Get on the train to Gion, the historic geisha district, and wander around a bunch. It’s beautiful after dark, with the old buildings lit up and the stream and everything. I see what I think might actually be a real geisha; there’s also a crowd of tourists literally running behind her with cameras which I think is very rude. \*\*$1.47\*\*
* After walking around for a few hours, I’m hungry; I stop at a cute place and get an order of gyoza and a glass of plum wine. \*\*$9.62\*\*
* I now walk across the river towards Nishiki market. I get fried chicken from a stand the people I met at the bar last night recommended and it is literally the best friend chicken I have ever had in my entire life. \*\*$2.75\*\*
* I stop at Daiso, which is essentially a dollar store, and get some cute stickers, greeting cards, a pack of those spiral hair ties, band aids because I’m getting some blisters/hot spots, and some random snacks/candy. \*\*$7.06\*\*
*  I go back to the chicken stand. Yes, it’s really that good. The guy recognizes me and gives me extra chicken this time; I am simultaneously delighted and ashamed. \*\*2.75\*\*
* I stop at a cool looking bar on my way back. It’s also rock and roll themed (not sure why this is such a thing here!) I get two drinks: one is some lychee liqueur and grapefruit juice and is AMAZING, and one is beer and orange soda and is terrible. The bartender is super nice and takes requests and I get him to play Rumours by Fleetwood Mac in its entirety. Iconic. We have a really fun conversation via Google translate; it’s one of the highlights of the trip. \*\*$12.83\*\*
* Train back to hostel: \*\*$1.47\*\*

**Daily total: $187.79**

&amp;#x200B;

    Wednesday 10/23  

&amp;#x200B;

\* Jet lag returns. I stop at Family Mart for breakfast and get a chocolate chip melon bun, a hot bottled coffee because apparently they have those here, and also blister band-aids. \*\*\~$6.87\*\*

\* I take the train to Nijo Castle: \*\*\~$3.67\*\*

\* I also leave my suitcase in a locker at the train station: \*\*$3.67\*\*

\* Nijo castle is absolutely beautiful, both inside and the gardens, and ends up being my favorite place I visited the whole trip. It’s amazing and worth every penny of the admission: \*\*$9.62\*\*

\* One of my favorite parts of the castle was the silk painted tapestries on the walls of pine trees, tigers, eagles, flowers, and more. From the gift shop I buy what they call “towels” but look more like screen printed fabric that I plan to hang up at home: \*\*$13.20\*\*

\* Vending machine green tea: \*\*1.47\*\*

\* Train to Southern Higashiyama district: \*\*$2.02\*\*

\* I do a traditional Japanese tea ceremony! It’s super cool to learn about the history of the ceremony, and also to learn how to properly make matcha. Also it is delicious. I pre-booked this online for: \*\*$28.71\*\*

\* I walk around a little and then get tempura udon for lunch: \*\*$11.46\*\*

\* I walk around a little more and then stop for matcha ice cream: \*\*$3.21\*\*

\* I walk around a bunch and go to various temples along the philosophers path, but don’t end up paying the admission to go inside any of them / others are free. I regret this a little but weirdly you kind of get burned out on temples (I know.)

\* Vending machine peach flavored black tea (this becomes my new fav): \*\*$1.47\*\*

\* More philosophers path! This is so cool and beautiful and it’s kind of a grey day right before sunset and I’m listening to Lana Del Rey and the mood is fantastic but also my feet hurt so when I reach the northern end, I take the bus back to the train station where I left my suitcase: \*\*$2.02\*\*

\* And then another train back to my hostel: \*\*$1.47\*\*

\* I end up eating dinner at the restaurant at my hostel just because I’m too tired to look for something or walk around. I get fish and chips and a local craft beer: \*\*$13.75\*\*

\* I planned on going to bed super early, but I end up striking up a conversation with some other people at the restaurant/bar. They end up being from California and are all super nice and fun and we get along really well! I tell them about the bar I went to last night and they’re intrigued, so we walk over. I get a random drink of something Japanese I’ve never heard before that tastes very … botanical. \*\*$6.42\*\*

\* My new bffs all got more than one drink each so they decide we should go do karaoke in one of those places with private rooms. I agree. It’s very very very fun. We get sake there because there’s a 1 drink/person minimum and that’s the cheapest thing on the menu. Someone with better Japanese pays and tells me my share is \*\*$4.58\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Daily total: $113.61\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

    Thursday 10/24  

&amp;#x200B;

\* Wake up super early again and it’s pouring rain. I realize later this was literally a typhoon lol it just didn’t hit Kyoto especially hard. I go to 7-11 to buy breakfast and get an egg sandwich, a hot bottled coffee, and also an umbrella.  \*\*\~$11.00\*\* 6

\* Take the train to Fushimi Inari: \*\*$2.02\*\*

\* Luckily I got here really early and also it’s raining so the gate path, which I’ve heard gets really crowded, is quite empty and I can wander around and take pictures and pet some stray cats. It is so beautiful and calming and I love it. I intended to go all the way up the mountain, but I took a wrong turn at some point and ended up accidentally exiting the shrine area entirely via a service road that spits me out in a neighborhood a full train stop away from where I started. Lol oops.

\* I take the train to Nara for the rest of my day, a little earlier than intended but oh well. \*\*\~$7.33\*\*

\* Arrive in Nara and almost immediately see roaming friendly deer. Get some pets in. Excellent. Then I go to a free garden (beautiful) and then a paid garden (even more beautiful!!!! I have become obsessed with gardens). It’s still pouring rain but it’s so beautiful and lush and green \*\*$8.25\*\*

\* I do get quite cold and wet eventually though so I go into a tea house inside the garden and get a cup of matcha and a red bean sweet \*\*$7.79\*\*

\* I then walk up to a huge old temple with a huuuuuuuuuge buddha inside and huge huge guardian statues outside. Admission: \*\*$5.50\*\*

\* I buy mushroom soba for lunch: \*\*$7.56\*\*

\* More temples, free. Vending machine peach tea: \*\*$1.47\*\*

\* Mooooore walking around, more temples, more petting of the deer. At some point some really adorable Japanese schoolchildren come up to me and interview me as an assignment for their English class and it. is. so. cute. I eventually spend ages walking around outside in the rain because I wanted to go to this sake distillery for a tasting and I thought it opened at 5. It closes at 5. Kill me.

\* I’m so annoyed by this and also so wet and my feet hurt so much that I just get on a train back to Kyoto \*\*\~$7.33\*\*

\* I get back and I’m too tired to figure out dinner so I just get a bunch of 7-11 snacks and drinks and hang out in the hostel lounge reading. I become a huge fan of the \~$1.50 a can 9% abv apple flavored shochu drinks. \*\*$7.48\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Daily total: $65.73\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

    Friday 10/25  

&amp;#x200B;

\* I buy breakfast from my hostel. I get a latte and a chocolate croissant. \*\*$7.33\*\*

\* Then I get the bus to Kyoto Station: \*\*$2.02\*\*

\* Locker for my suitcase: \*\*$4.58\*\*

\* Train to Arashiyama: \*\*$2.38\*\*

\* I walk around the bamboo forest a bunch. It’s very beautiful but pretty crowded and still pouring rain and it’s not a good combo. I was planning on doing another temple and the monkey park here as well but I’m super not feeling it so I take the train back to central Kyoto \*\*2.38\*\*

\* I go to this cool tea shop and do a tasting ($10.08) and then buy a bunch of tea for myself, as well as for gifts for my mom ($50.42): \*\*$60.50\*\*

\* I walk back through the market and end up ducking into a cute boutique where I get 3 pairs of handmade earrings; one for myself, two as gifts for my roommate. \*\*$23.37\*\*

\* I was going to go to the chicken stand again and get more (YES I have a problem) but it was closed. Grab a doner kebab wrap for lunch instead. \*\*$4.58\*\*

\* There’s a direct route to Osaka from the train line I’m currently closest to, but my luggage is still back at the Kyoto Station so I take the bus there: \*\*$2.02\*\*

\* Train to Osaka: \*\*$4.58\*\*

\* Check into my hostel, lie down and relax a little, and then head over to Dotonbori market to get dinner. There’s a ton of places that look good but are full, or don’t have English menus, or something else, but I eventually end up at a yakiniku place. I get wagyu beef (that I grill myself!) and a beer. \*\*$41.25\*\*

\* I walk over to another cool bar recommended online, another one that does custom drinks based on what you request flavor wise. This one is super hidden speakeasy style and I almost don’t find it, which is a fun adventure all on its own. I have two drinks. \*\*$24.75\*\*

\* I stop and get 7-11 chips and a chocolate bar on my way back to the hostel. \*\*$2.75\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Daily Total: $182.49\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

    Saturday 10/26  

* Train to Osaka castle: \*\*\~$4.58\*\*
* 7-11 breakfast of pan au chocolat and bottled hot coffee: \*\*$3.21\*\*
*  Luggage locker: \*\*$3.67\*\*
* I walk around Osaka castle and take a ton of pictures of the outside and the moats and explore some of the grounds. It’s super beautiful and cool and ENORMOUS. I’d heard the inside isn’t worth the price of admission so I head back to the train station. On the way, I see a takoyaki stand and get some, since it’s an Osaka specialty. (I kind of hate it, but I’m glad I gave it a try.) \*\*$4.58\*\*
* Snacks for train (potato straw thingies, canned drink bc Japan doesn’t have open container laws) \*\*$2.24\*\*
* Take shinkansen back to Tokyo. I get a window seat and am able to see Mount Fuji outside the window as we go past which is VERY VERY COOL. Also legal day drinking on public transportation really does elevate the experience. \*\*$134.93\*\*
* Get back to Tokyo Station and go to Ramen street, which is located below the station. Get a very good bowl of some sort of shrimp ramen: \*\*$8.62\*\*
* Take train to my final hostel and check in. \*\*$1.82\*\*
* This hostel is in Asakusa which is kind of near the kitchen supply district and I wanna get some SOUVENIRS/gifts so I head back out right away before the shops close.
* I get an all-purpose stainless steel chefs knife. I was originally shopping for my brother but I pick this knife up one time and immediately realize I want it for myself so I …. buy it for myself. \*\*$99.00\*\*
* At a different knife shop, I see a carbon steel meat/vegetable knife that I think will be good for my brother. It’s not as nice as the one I bought myself, but it looks cooler and more authentically Japanese \*\*$64.17\*\*
* I go to Uniqlo because I literally am out of shirts. I get a mockneck sweater so I have something clean to wear tomorrow and a zip-up teddy fleece because I’ve been missing out on this trend. \*\*$28.13\*\*
* I go to Don Quijote for more souvenirs. I get Pokemon face masks for my friend, and a ton of candy including 4 flavors of kit-kats for everyone, including myself. \*\*$30.30\*\*
* I stop at Lawson and get the chicken nuggets that are supposed to be amazing. They’re pretty good but they still taste like chicken nuggets from a convenience store tbh. \*\*2.60\*\*
* Walk around Sensoji temple at night; it’s beautiful all lit up.
* Stop at a bar that looks cute and get a Negroni. \*\*$12.83\*\*
* Get some snacks before I head back to my hostel since I didn’t really eat dinner: \*\*$3.88\*\*

**Daily Total: $404.56** (yikes!)

&amp;#x200B;

    Sunday 10/27  

* Go to a coffee shop that’s supposed to be really amazing and buy my dad some really nice coffee that’s roasted there. I also get myself a cortado because I need caffeine to live and I’m still waking up at 5am. \*\*$22.00\*\*
* Go to Don Quijote and get my dad a mini bottle of some pretty bad whiskey (he’s more of a coffee drinker than a whiskey drinker; it’s more about the novelty of the label): \*\*$4.95\*\*
* Go to this cool store that makes super detailed plastic replicas of food and buy my friend a magnet with a replica of sea urchin sushi: \*\*$15.86\*\*
* Take the train a few stops to Ueno Park: \*\*$1.72\*\*
* Luggage locker: \*\*$6.42\*\*
* Go to Ichiran and get a bowl of customized ramen. There’s a bit of a wait but it’s worth it: \*\*$10.08\*\*
* Go to the convenience store and buy a white grape flavored Strong Zero: \*\*$1.42\*\*
* Walk around Ueno Park and the pond; it’s a really beautiful day. Find a bench and sit and drink my strong zero and watch the people on the swan/paddle boats and just really enjoy my last hour or so here.
* Time to go :( back to station, buy ticket on Skyliner back to Narita Airport: \*\*$23.19\*\*
* After I make it back through security etc etc, I have about an hour to kill so I try to use up the very last of my yen. Buy another lemon soda, another peach tea, and some random snacks. I’m left with less than $1 on my refillable transit card and about 35 cents in cash, which I feel v smug about.  \*\*$5.87\*\*

**Daily Total: 91.51**

&amp;#x200B;

    Sunday 10/27 AGAIN

* Chickpea kale salad: **$12.34**
* Tim Hortons latte and timbits: **$4.75**
* Chips and Coke Zero: **$4.54**
* When I arrive back in Chicago, I intend to take the blue line back home, especially since I haven’t been able to switch the SIM cards back out and my phone isn’t working. However the blue line is totally and mysteriously fucked so I get on O’Hare wifi and order a Lyft share home. **$29.56**

    Reflection

I spent a LOTTTT on this trip but ultimately I do think it was all worth it! I haven't done a ton of traveling before this and I saved up for ages to go; both consciously for a few months since I started planning and before that just keeping "international travel" as a vague future goal to motivate me to live below my means and try not to splash out too much. I didn't gain any credit card debt from this trip whatsoever. The things I would change in the future are 1) looking harder for cheap flights 2) I don't currently get any miles/points/whatever from a travel card, I do cash back only, and I know some people save a ton doing that kind of churning.

I was wondering if someone has been to Incredible Pizza lately could give me some insight as I haven’t been. I found a coupon for .99 buffet with an $18 game card which sounds like a fun date night for my boyfriend and I. My question is, will $18 be a decent amount for each person to play? Is this establishment alright for adults or is it more catered towards children such as Chuck E Cheese is? I just don’t want to suggest this and then it be an awful idea 😂
Lol came out for the 1.3x boost just to make an easy $10 to treat myself to a pizza for lunch. 2.5 hrs later and I'm starving and the 1 McUber order for $3 isn't gonna cut it! Also multi-apping with GH and not a single order yet just the one McUber. I should've just stayed home and ate a pb&amp;j sammich and went back to sleep!.


Hi guys, I made a reddit profile just to make this post! I’m a 20 year old girl, 4’11in 135lbs and I’ve intermittent fasted on and off for a few months now. I decided to journey towards a full 7 day water fast before I go keto and almost 48 hours in I realize how soul crushing this whole thing has become lol. I’m not as hungry as I thought I’d be but the cravings are hitting me like a truck, I mean I just sat and cried for 30 minutes because I couldn’t eat a pizza lmfao. I’m currently 44 hours in and my stomach feels like it’s eating itself. Besides cravings, I noticed that I haven’t seen any noticeable weight changes......how much weight loss should I expect at the end of this? how do you guys keep going when your entire body starts screaming to just eat? How do you guys stay motivated?
Thanks!!!


I am struggling so much with this issue. Thoughts welcome!

Okay my DH was taught in his anger management classes and therapy that if he is frustrated, angry, wanting to lash out, etc., he needs to LEAVE the situation...

I have always been treated with the idea that leaving a conversation is 1) dismissive of the other person 2) invalidates their feelings 3) puts the "leaver" in charge and therefore is straight up manipulation.
 You have a problem? You STAY and work it out with the person, even if that means calling in sick to work and ordering pizza. Needless to say, this has caused many problems because my DH cannot talk  about things when he is emotional (he yells  a lot) and I cannot talk about things later if he has left in a fit of anger.


Arrrrrgh....

As I sit here on November 12 at 12:40 PM. I am sitting at my desk trying to find distractions so I won’t be hungry and start craving food that I don’t need. My manager is ordering us pizza because we have what is called “Transfer Tuesday”. That is when different colleges come to our community college to table and recruit people from a two-year university to therefore their four year university. So I was talking to my manager and typically she orders Cosmo pizza which is practically like New York slice pizza but it's two slices and one basically..... I have a feeling that I’m about to go overboard because I haven’t really ate all day because I’m trying to do the intermediate fasting. So by seeing the pizza it's just gonna have me triggered...

How do I even hide cause I don’t want to eat all those slices since I will be the one watching it! I just need some positive encouragement right now before the pizza man gets here..

Heya! I'm Jayme. Currently waiting for the slowest Dominos delivery driver in existence to bring me my food so hey, what a better time to make a new friend!

It's my birthday, turning 22 today. Weird to type it out. I'm from Ireland and I work in I.T for the Irish government. I have hobbies and interests in a bit of everything, from psychology to fashion to history to photography. Whatever interests me on the day! I also suck at typing about myself but I love to learn about other people and their walks of lives. It's fascinating to me.

PM me your top 3 pizza toppings!


I find astrology interesting to read about!

Good morning peoples, how are you? Are you looking for a casual chat about day to day stuff, mixed in with memes and thoughtful topics? Looking to possibly hang out if we connect well?  Possibly develop interest in cuddling with movie/show marathons, play some games together, etc? 

I like to put a face to who I talk to, but it's totally okay if you'd rather not or would like to talk a bit beforehand! 

In terms of something more developing I could be open to it! I've been seeking that long term companion that you connect with on a deep level and have that strong attraction for one another :) nothing long distance though

**All that being said purely platonic talk is perfectly fine and there doesn't need to be intentions of something more or anything.**

If you've seen Joker we can definitely discuss it! I thought it was such an excellent film and has become my favorite live action portrayal of the character! 
If you watch Mr. Robot that's a plus!

It's also a plus if you happen to watch the streamer/youtuber Uberhaxornova! 

**About Me:**

• Random Trivia: the movie COCO made me cry 

• I LOVE Marvel/DC, anime, books, gaming, and binging shows

• I have light hazel eyes if eyes are your thing 

• **I'm a big homebody**, but despite it I'm into going to the movies, hiking occasionally, and I want to visit more museums! (Been to the Met in NY) And I really want to go stargazing one day

• I have a diverse taste in music, ranging from hiphop, spanish, to 70's-90's music. (playlists are welcome!) 

Talk to you soon and if you're not interested take care/be safe! 

(Bonus if you've made it this far: What is your favorite dessert?)
**Updated: 11-12**

All of the following albums are up for sale/trade. US trading only; sorry international collectors. 

I've traded with quite a few on here and try to keep my albums updated. 

If you see something you like but don't have anything on my list just ask. I tend to pick up other stuff not on there more often then not. I will probably make trades in your favor for castings on my list of looking for, but I'm also not just giving the stuff away. 

I hope to make a deal with you and if you have any questions send me a message/chat.

In the case you would like to trade, I am looking for [these CMFs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMQXEEMJEDNgVYNguMQhRMQ-CkS6vfQ_dSf0MxzkUZk/edit#gid=0) and would be using the 6 month average on Bricklink as a value estimation instead of the above quoted price.
I’ve been doing so well trying not to purge. Well, it’s only been 4 days, but I b/p multiple times a day lately. I just don’t know how to stop myself from bingeing. Like I could eat a small meal and be fine with that until the next meal, but nooo... I take that small meal and turn it into enough meals to feed my entire family for 3 days. And I CANNOT STOP. Like I have no control, what else is there to feed my face? Oh, an entire pie? An entire bag of chips? Half of a pizza?my kids leftover buttery noodles that were supposed to be for his dinner tonight?

So anyway, I was doing well. Then I went grocery shopping, stuck to my list like a good girl until the very end... where Walmart prepackaged sushi caught my eye. I knew it would be shit. But I didn’t care. I bought 2 packs. Then a box of cookies, 4 mini pies, 2 hot food egg rolls, a fried chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets, Doritos and a Diet Coke.

Does anyone have advice on how to snap out of feeling like I need to binge? I might as well just take my money and flush it down the toilet. Maybe it’s time for me to seek professional help?

Hey there. I have this girl that I have gotten really close to over the past few months. She is really, really great but I am trying to give her some space because she has some stuff she wants to figure out. So, that is why I am making this post. I am looking for another girl I can talk to and laugh with while letting her sort of have some alone time. I'll tell you a bit about me too:

- I am a scuba diving instructor.

- I LOVE animals.

- I have been craving pizza nonstop for the past month. Lol.

- I once made and drank my own wine when I was 14 and it was the worst, most painful thing I'd ever done.

- Also, I once stole the pregnancy belly from the home economics room in high school and wore it around. When the teachers tried to take it away from me for disturbing classes I screamed, "That's my baby! Don't take my baby!"

Haha. That's enough. You'll learn more about me when we talk.

Also, yes, I am a guy online asking for a clean chat. I know that seems unlikely but I really don't want any temptations because this other girl means a lot to me. I am strictly looking for a friend.
Top floor living space in beautiful home in Guilford available for lease as of Dec 1. I bought the house earlier this year. It's in an amazing location- like a little oasis a couple blocks from JHU, Union Memorial Hospital, the restaurants on St. Paul, and 3 miles north of the Inner Harbor.  There's a large yard, empty driveway, soon to be a pizza oven in the backyard. The top floor consists of a nice size bedroom, little hallway with 2 significant closets, and 1 full bathroom which would all be your own space. The rest of the house including basement with laundry room is shared space.  

I'm a physical therapist and my boyfriend is a mechanical engineer/bike and car mechanic/woodworker. I enjoy running, climbing, cooking/eating, drawing.  The house is a great place for anyone, especially for students who want to have a private place to study with a relatively quiet rest of the house, but then to join in fun whenever you need a break, and there is even space for a couple. We've been enjoying bonfires in the backyard, and excited about making pizza outside once the oven is done. Come join us! Please contact me with any questions!
To simplify, its basically Better Pizza vs getting out-pizza'd by the hut.
I got fired from a robloxian pizza parlour three years ago so today i questioned myself this: is there an bigger than usual job, like a secret agent for example, that you get paid in robux?
Happy Taco Tuesday!

Single, 32 y/o, M here from sunny California. 

It’s a work from home kind of day for me. Just finished some lunch (pizza) and got through a pair of Netflix episodes of Mind of a Chef. I am a huge Dave Chang fan. Foodie in general, holiday season will mean breaking out a few Christina Tosi recipes. I’m excited!

Milf chocolate &gt; dark chocolate &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; white chocolate 

When it comes to Netflix what do you enjoy? I always find it hard to get into new shows. I’m too busy binging the same shows over and over. Whether it’s spending time with Frank Underwood, Jeff Dunham, or NCIS, I’m pretty predictable. 

While Disney+ has everyone’s attention, I’ll stick with PlutoTV and rewatching Dog the Bounty Hunter or old episodes of the Laguna Beach. 

I’m a sports nerd. Love this time of the year, even with baseball finished, there’s still so much to enjoy. 

As far as taco Tuesday...I typically go two shredded beef tacos and a carnitas taco.
I generally support this spending and believe it’s good for Tulsa and recognize that major public investment projects never please everyone. I’d rather spend and accept that bureaucracy is messy than do nothing. 

However, one line item continues to bother me. Why does the police department need another cost-intensive helicopter? What are the lifetime costs after the initial $4.5 million price tag? Life flight, fire, search and rescue all having helos makes sense to me.

But a gleaming new police helicopter in the 21st century has the strong odor of toys for boys. What function could a police helo perform that a third-party drone operator could not for a tiny fraction of the cost? Amazon is very close to doorstep drone delivery. So is Domino’s Pizza. Additionally, privacy controls can be programmed into drones but not human analysts. 

It would be safer for police. It would make more officers available on the ground. They’d be looking at a surveillance display viewable from the air or the ground. FLIR replaced the old spotlights TPD once used to track suspects.

Surely TPD will argue this spending replaces an aging aircraft. But that begs the question: Why are we replacing it in the first place? Why not just sell it?

[when mom says pizza rolls have been made.](https://preview.redd.it/m5hzuvf2iby31.jpg?width=217&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13878bae93b0178af1af86e509f5e0d8d93d30be)
I initially tried posting in r/pizza as well, but apparently text posts aren't allowed?  So, I'm pretty new to making pizza at home. I have the right tools, but in the past it's been the lack of oomph that my resulting pizza has that makes me tell myself that it's not worth the trouble and time.  Wellp , the wife asked me to make a pie this week and damned if I'm not going to make a great one this time.  To begin I wanted a solid recipe without too many special ingredients and familiar processes.  Soon after my search began I found a recipe for [Roberta's](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016230-robertas-pizza-dough?regi=1&amp;join_cooking_newsletter=true&amp;login=facebook) with 4k reviews.  Relative to how popular and great the other recipes were, this seemed to be a no brainier selection.  Obtained everything on the list and went to begin prep last night for the overnight rise.  I chose the method of weighing every ingredient as it had them all in grams and volumetric units.  While it probably has the least influence on the scientific processes that are taking place, the salt didn't add up to me.  Recipe calls for 8g (1tsp) of salt - fine sea salt.  Admittedly, I don't have that on hand and was just going to use a 1:1 sub with my normal Diamond Crystal.  Based on a salt conversion chart that [Morton offers](https://www.mortonsalt.com/article/salt-conversion-chart/) the choice to sub 1:1 didn't seem too far off.  So, placed my dish on my scale and tare. As I begin weighing it out, I realize that 8g of salt is much more than 1 tsp. One mistake I made is that since I'm familiar and comfortable with baking, I was just weighing one ingredient after the other in the same bowl, taring between.  So once I began adding salt in, I couldn't take it back out.  I put two or three grams in followed by a pinch which I'm volume, looked to be maybe the teaspoon that the recipe describes.  I'm times like this, should I follow the volumetric measurements for the recipe or stick with the weights no matter what?

I know that's a lot of unnecessary info for such the simple question, but hey, I don't post or get out a lot so this is where I get chatty lol!

I'm planning to redo the recipe today as I later found out this morning that I don't think my yeast was still active.  Sealed package but beyond the expiration date - well beyond.  Woke up and checked them and they honestly looked even smaller I'm size 😂😭.

Thanks for the help everyone.

For some background I’m a 22F in nursing school. Fiancé owns the house. Our roommate will be moving out in January I just don’t know how to deal with him for the remainder of time left. My fiancé is working out of town and I’m going crazy. 

He’s started being really creepy asking to take pictures of my outfits to send to “his girlfriend”.. making comments about how pretty he thinks I am. My fiancé is working out of town and when I’m home studying or doing pretty much anything else - he comes and stands behind me, over my shoulder for waaaaay to long. It makes me so uncomfortable. He’s even said “sorry I don’t mean to be creepy” and giggles. Yet still does it even though I make it abundantly clear he creeps me out. He always tells me way too many details about his sex life. No matter how much I ignore him he will just talk and talk. My friends have made jokes like “oh yeah wonder what he does when he goes up stairs after standing too close to you all the time. Like everyone notices how weird he is. 

To get a better pictures of him -  he’s your typical neck beard.  He STINKS. I’m home almost all the time and he never showers. Like maybe once every two weeks and when he’s close to me and I smell his stinch and it disgusts me. I literally have to go light a candle or something it’s so bad. He NEVER does his dishes and leaves them in the sink for days. Never takes out the trash and just sits it next to the full trash can. Like I’m not his fucking maid. Something he ate exploded in the microwave and he left it there for days. I even said something about it and he was like “well if you buy a microwave plate I’ll use it.” Um how about you clean up your mess. He didn’t.. my fiancé cleaned it up. Especially now that my fiancé is working out of town this dude acts like it’s his house. He’s actively destroying our home and doesn’t listen to me when I ask to clean up. Fiancé says he doesn’t want to say anything and embarrass him. Thank god he’s moving soon. 

Just imagine a guy playing world of Warcraft all day and only getting up to answer the door for the pizza guy. I’m so fed up and I don’t know how to handle it.
Here’s my idea and if goPuff gets rich off of it I don’t care. Majority of the food delivery business is pizza, and majority of the food sold by restaurants is Pizza. GoPuff has oven pizzas on the menu. My idea is to make a hot pizza option in the app with the oven pizzas that are sold, and possibly wings. Heat the food in store and deliver it.

Becca\_Bae93: ↑\_(ΦwΦ;)Ψ

Becca\_Bae93: Please screenshot this conversation so we can enjoy this in the future over a glass of wine.

EsterAndrews: YOU are not twenty one yet, young lady!

AmiableJinx: I am though.

AngelWriter999: im very mature for my age

EsterAndrews: … Anyways

EsterAndrews: He bids me hello.

EsterAndrews: He’s quite fond of The Mirror! I didn’t think anyone noticed that poem. I’m almost embarrassed.

EsterAndrews: ‘No one appreciates your efforts. You are overshadowed by a stronger, brighter personality. I understand.’

EsterAndrews: ‘I am looking for someone to write something for me.’

EsterAndrews: ‘Price is no object. I only require that you would focus on what I want done and what I want done alone.’

EsterAndrews: Huh. I have found it hard to make rent since my husband left. And I want another cat.

Becca\_Bae93: Go for it!!!!!

AmiableJinx: What about Sky Light? We said we’d work on our stories together…

Becca\_Bae93: Who gives a SHIT rn Jinx?! Getting paid for writing is what you’ve always wanted, Ester!!!! Go for it. Charge him up the ass. ヽ(　･∀･)ﾉ

EsterAndrews: I mean, he doesn’t have to know when I’m not working on my personal projects. I really doubt he actually means all my time goes into what he wants done.

EsterAndrews: What do you think, Angel?

AngelWriter999: plz have lucifer’s babies

EsterAndrews: You’re hilarious.

EsterAndrews: I’m gonna do it!

Becca\_Bae93: YES!!!! Charge him fifty dollars an hour, no, seventy five for every hour you work!!!! Make sure he gives you the money upfront too!!!!

AmiableJinx: I feel like you’re gonna get scammed. Watch him ask for a donation to help the money ‘move faster’ or for her credit card number.

Becca\_Bae93: Did you just add the word amiable to your tag because you thought it sounded fancy?    (눈\_눈)

 Hot pizza is really tasty. So, here is our recipe for making the perfect Margherita pizza on the planet. Let's cook it together!
Sanic headed into a takeaway and ordered one of everything off the menu. He’s on first-name terms with the owner who calls him BOSS MAN every time he sees him. Sanic shook the mans hand and posed for photos before saying

“This man single-handled feeds me and I hope I’ve earned his trust to vote for me.” when the takeaway owner was asked who he would vote for he said “obviously voting Green. Never voting for those tories or those shitebags who have let the country fall apart this term.”

Sanic then walked out and was followed by thousands of supporters who wanted a bite of his deep-fried pizza, but he had eaten it by the time he reached the end of the road. He went straight into the Aldi and bought 8 milky bar yoghurts before heading home for the end of the campaign.
Hello! I am in need of companionship. I am not playing any games at my age. So what I am saying is that I want to meet a woman who I can share a life together. If you are going to ghost me. Don't be afraid to tell me that you are not interested. I am an adult, I know how to handle bad news. Just don't do the cruel thing by abandoning someone.

I am an Asian male, 5'8", about 250 lbs but I am currently sill losing the weight. I can describe my personality as mostly an introvert when I am lazy but I can be an extrovert if I am motivated enough. I love to laugh and try to make other people laugh too. I always think that laughing can bring us closer together. I am a pacifist but I can throw a punch if it is only use to protect someone. I am not afraid of showing my romantic side. We can share a candle lit dinner or we can stay home watch some Netflix while I hand feed you pizza and ice cream. If you ever have a bad day or just need someone,  I can be that person you can rely on for support. I have no problem in dropping what I was doing because you take priority. I am easily a non judgemental and open minded person. I've learned trust and communication is key for a long lasting relationship. Speaking of learning! I love to learn new things, it can be either science facts or weird trivia. I do have a career as a professional drafter in a construction supplier company. All tho, I have other ambitions and I am excited to move forward with some changes.

My interests/ hobbies are pretty nerdy in general. I am primarily a PC gamer.  I built my own PC and if you like I can build you one too. I love to sightsee interesting places like museums or watch the stars out in the desert. I'll listen to any music that can get me moving or singing! I love movies and TV shows. I can watch any generic action film, comic book/super hero film, to art house film. I am learning new hobbies like archery and piano. I am also a psychonaut. Ask me more about it if you know what it is.

What I am looking for in a woman around the age of 25-35. My preferences are latina or caucasian and HWP. Also, prefer someone local or in the same state as I am. Thank you for understanding. I would be hoping that this person would be nerdy, intelligent, self reliant, selfless, compassionate, faithful, honest, and a sense of humor. I am a simple guy with simple needs. I will be going to ask you for a photo verification. I've been catfished/scammed before and don't want that to happen again. I will do the same photo verification for you. Don't be afraid to have a chat with me. I am open for a conversation! We can talk about anything you like.

Been in the city for a few months now and my girlfriend and I are still searching for our go to takeout pizza place. When we actually want to spend money and go out for pizza then we tend to head to Victory but for cheap pizza what is the best in the area?

Additional followup we are also still looking for a good all you can eat sushi place in the area.

Thanks

- Spock

It’s the year 2045. A new transit train is approved linking Algona and Mercer Island...with no stops in between. The Mercer Islanders fight tooth and nail to prevent their beautiful island from being overrun by Algonians. From the depths of his mansion, Paul Allen creates a time machine to travel back in time and prevent the events that lead to the train becoming a reality (actually he had a time machine just kinda laying around). He must find the legendary Goldberg who holds the keys to the biggest protest movement Mercer Island has ever seen (and that is saying something - look at all the election signage around there): Goldberg’s registered voters list.

Paul begins his search in the Roanoke, where he finds Bitburger beer, nostalgia for the roaring teens, and a warm environment where everyone knows his name.

I’d say the crown jewel of Mercer Island is The Roanoke Inn. The odd thing about Mercer Island, for me, is that it seems like everything is hidden. Roanoke is one of these things. It’s off the beaten path a little. You’re driving and you think you’re just in a neighborhood and you almost turn around because you figure you’re lost. But you’re not lost. Roanoke is right in front of you. It looks like someone’s house. Like someone, at sometime, just said “Fuck it. Everyone’s over here all the time anyway. Let’s start charging.” The food is hit or miss, the beer selection is great and the outdoor seating is like being at some English garden party. Mercer Island is a rich area, but if you go to Roanoke, you see none of the pretension you would figure. It’s a very warm bar with good folks...that could buy and sell you.

Moving along, Paul thinks about Goldberg and his deli and his love for - BAGELS!

There’s an Einstein’s Bagels on Mercer Island. It’s been awhile since bagels have been all the rage. I remember in the mid 90s they were a big thing. You’d get bagels and bagel sandwiches and bagels and lox and then people just stopped being big on bagels. Maybe because they are bad for you. Or maybe because bagels remind you of that hole in your life. That empty chasm that you can’t ever fill, so you blame it on bagels. And that’s really sad.

With no sign of Goldberg in Einstein’s, Paul travels farther back in time to the 1930s just for the fuck of it.

What can be surprising about Mercer Island is the number of homes that have been owned since the early twentieth century. What you get is people that are not rich - just comfortable enough to pay the taxes. This surprised me, when I went to a friend’s apartment (top floor of a house) and found out the woman who lived there barely scraped by. On Mercer Island. The house had a view of the water and across the lake.

Bored with the 1930s and the lack of Jimmy, Paul traveled back to 2016.

This is the second rich city edition of Destinations. Three, if you count Issaquah. In fact, every sentence in Destinations should end with “If you count Issaquah.” But, anyway...one thing I’ve noticed, and I haven’t really spent huge amounts of time in the Mercer Island community, is that it’s not snobbish. I mean, there’s probably a bunch of snobs, but on the surface, I don’t see them. It’s more like a backwater neighborhood with money. Like on the other islands around the Puget Sound. This surprised me when I went to the Roanoke, the grocery stores, etc.

Paul’s memory could not be trusted, so he ventured to his own house and interviewed himself about the whereabouts of Goldberg.

Paul Allen is the most well-known rich guy on Mercer Island. He has an interesting history of being co-founder of Nintendo and....oh, wait, No. It’s not Nintendo. It’s Coleco and Texas Instruments! He founded them in his kitchen, while his pet project, Microsoft, he kept out in the garage with chronic stoner Bill Gates. Paul also runs or owns, or inherited from Captain Kirk and View to a Kill, Vulcan. Little did Paul know, Gates was creating a time machine. And, in fact, the Gates that Allen knew was actually a different version of Gates. You see, when you travel in time, there’s this loop and - just watch Primer. It’ll wreck your entire work day the next day as you try to figure this shit out. Anyway, Allen is also known for buying up large parcels of Seattle and pissing people off. I remember when I lived in Seattle there was tons of FUCK PAUL ALLEN graffiti. He also created EMP, the chemical processing plant at the Seattle Center. Anyway, he later sold Seattle to Amazon or Yahoo. I don’t remember.

Paul gave little to no information on Goldberg’s whereabouts as he was creating The Bellevue from the future with his slide rule and a box of tacks. Paul ventured out to his hydroplane and cruised Seafair looking for Goldberg.

Seafair is the annual boating festival for rich people and women’s tits. From all over the area, people flock to events around the city celebrating getting drunk near bodies of water. There are the infamous Seafair Pirates who make attempted rape and theft legal for three days. In fact, I once was awakened by a number of them in a parking lot near Key Arena. I had an apartment there, and I was way hung over. I started hearing clown horns and shouting. I looked out my window and saw a number of clowns and pirates in the parking lot across the street cavorting. I had totally forgot about Seafair and thought we were being invaded by Canada. Anyway, if you have a friend on Mercer Island, it’s a great place to watch the fair and the hydros. Do they still do the hydros? Hyrdos used to be big in Seattle, but I never hear about them anymore. I know part of growing up around here was finding a bandsaw and making your own hyrdo to tie to the back of your bike and riding it around the neighborhood yelling “Look at me, I’m a hydroplane!” before being hit by a Datsun. I once dated a girl that got paid to deliver pizzas out to the boats during Seafair. She heard the plea “Show us your tits” more than she cared to recall. I asked if she ever showed em’ and she said “No.” But she was a liar.

Paul gave up his search for Goldberg on the high seas (lots of dope at Seafair) and made way for shore. There on the shore, wouldn’t you know it:

BDPD: Mr. Allen, do you know how fast you were going?

Paul: Probably super fast - it’s a fucking hyrdoplane.

BDPD: Really?

Paul: Yes.

BDPD: Can we have a ride?

Paul: No.

BDPD: Please!

Paul: No.

BDPD: Fine. We’ll go back to the bakery and smoke our meat in Black Diamond - but we’ll get you!

At one time - probably around 2000 - there was affordable apartments on Mercer Island. I say affordable only because the people I knew at the time were making around 50 grand a year (I know income is relative, but my point is they weren’t rich) and were able to live there...in apartments. I don’t know if that’s the case now.

After Paul shook the police from Black Diamond, he decided to search the rest of Seattle, off the island, for Goldberg. But…

Mercer Island is right where the traffic starts (if you’re lucky) if you’re going west on I90. It could be a clear day, every sports team has left the city, and Nickleback is playing the Key. Doesn’t matter. Traffic will always surround Mercer. There’s always that ugly feeling of driving passed Island Crest and going “I made it! I made it! I….SHEEEEIT!”

Allen returned to his vehicle and swerved around a massive protest.

Back when I’d commute to the Eastside from Seattle I’d stop at Mercer Island to get gas or coffee and I remember seeing a lot of protests, even in the morning hours, over international events. Which was odd, because typically you can drive through Mercer Island and see a jogger and a woman walking out of QFC tops.

Paul, on the verge of giving up, traveled forward in time to see just how bad the Algonians would ruin Mercer Island. It was pretty bad. A number of AMPMs that sold hotdogs and nunchucks had appeared overnight. Crime skyrocketed. Drugs became commonplace and the people of Mercer Island no longer were allowed to use people from Kent as dock lines for their boats. As the Island fell further into chaos, Paul watched as Paul from the future hit “The Button”. For years, Vulcan had worked on a button that would submerge the island in just such a scenario, killing both the Islanders and the Algonians, but keeping the pristine beauty of Mercer Island, plus the Roanoke.

Paul wept and returned to the time machine only to travel as far as he had been to see the island "settled" by two men who would boat from Seattle to pick berries. I’m not making this part up. Mercer Island (in the European sense) would not exist without two men and their love of berries.

Paul ate a few berries and traveled into the future in time to see Barack Obama’s Mother attend high school at Mercer Island. “Hello, Obama’s Momma.” Paul said to the confused woman.

Back to the time machine, Allen traveled once again to 2016 to personally bitch out the CEO of the Mariners, who also lives on the island, for another failed shot at the Series.

Paul was tired and wanted a sandwich. He traveled back in time to Albertsons.

There was once an Albertsons on the island. Which is weird, because Albertsons was kinda the poor people’s QFC. But there it was. Until they merged with Safeway and tried to take out Haggen, but then Haggen sued or something and then all the Albertsons became Haggens, but Haggen sucked so hard they went out of business. Anyway, that Albertsons was the only one I know of that had a kosher deli. That’s like 7-11 having a kosher deli. Mind. Boggled.

Back to 2016 and a stop at Zaw. I had Zaw once via Amazon Fresh. It was really good. It’s like a hippie take on take and bake places. I recommend it.

I remember a Mexican restaurant I went to on Mercer Island back in 99 and I don’t know if it’s El Sombrero or not...does anyone know how long Sombrero has been around? Doesn’t matter. That’s where Paul found Goldberg, sitting at a table with me trying to explain The Bellevue.

“Hey, do you have that voter registration? I need to stop a plan by the Algonians to invade Mercer Island and sell vapes like way in the future. Like when I shouldn’t even be alive.”

Without missing a beat. “Certainly. Here you go.”

With that, Paul put on the biggest campaign in Washington state to save something.

Bigger than the Sonics?

You bet your sweet ass!

But it didn’t pass because of a tax that was (will be) included.

But they pushed it through anyway, like Safeco.

The End (if you count Issaquah).
And where’s the beer? Can I eat pizza? Where’s my pizza man? Where’s the pizza?

Five years ago I got gastritis and GERD from a doctor telling me to take naproxen every day for a back injury, but gave me zero warning about the side effects (I took it every day for like a month). I couldn’t eat spicy food, greasy food, apples, onions, tomatoes, etc, would wake up in the middle of the night with awful acid reflux, and I was on 40mg omeprazole. 

After I learned about the negative long term effects of being on omeprazole and the importance of acid in your stomach, I weaned myself off of it and switched to an array of supplements such as slippery elm, DGL licorice, Pepzin GI, Absorb Aid, and probiotics. Fortunately, it was a huge success, and for the past several years, I’ve been able to eat absolutely anything with zero gastritis or GERD symptoms whatsoever. Habanero enchiladas, jalapeños, pizza, burgers, you name it.

I would believe I was 100% cured if it weren’t for one exception. Often when I drink alcohol, I still experience a burning sensation in my stomach. I usually take some slippery elm tablets beforehand and that totally or significantly mitigates the burning feeling, but I can’t help but wonder, how can I eat absolutely anything and be totally fine, but still feel burning from one single beer? (it’s only like 5% alcohol anyway).

I haven’t had an endoscopy done since I first got the gastritis (and even then when it was giving me problems, they said it was only “light gastritis”). Not sure if any of you are familiar with the late and great Dr. John E. Sarno, but he believed most symptoms of physical pain such as back pain or digestive issues were caused by the mind. I can’t help but wonder if the fear of feeling stomach burning when I drink alcohol is what’s causing the sensation rather than the alcohol itself. It just doesn’t seem logical to me how a habanero enchilada can cause me no issues, but one beer can.

What do you guys think?


So there's this thought that's been bothering me for the past few days. Since March I developed a lot of behaviours which comply with "textbook" anorexia. Not only in my relationship with food but also my self-image and self-esteem. Right now I realize the mistakes I made and that losing 40 pounds (from March to end of July) was not at all healthy (keep in mind that when I started restricting not only was I at a normal weight for my height but also that I've never been one to "plump" much). Right now I'm in a much better place phisically but mentally I still feel in shambles. I've given up some of my restrictions and stopped with the calorie counting. Also, I've started eating more regularly and gained some weight already. The thing is. I just want food. I feel capable of eating and eating and not stopping. I believed it to be normal in recovery but I think I'm already so close to what is a good weight for me that maybe I just can't keep telling myself that. Am I using it just as an excuse to eat what I want? I've never had any troubles with food in the past, quite the contrary. I've been one to always eat whatever I want (be it snacks, cookies, pizza, ... ) and not gain much weight. But right now all I think about is "oh I can't eat that", "oh I've eaten so much today, why do I want more?". It's also starting to have a really bad effect on my grades and my motivation to deal with all other mathers of life. These last weeks I've even had some suicidal thoughts, which it had been months I didn't have one. Also, I've been going out a lot to dinner which is becoming a bit too pricy but I don't feel comfortable eating at home (just the thought of seating in the couch watching Netflix and eating a cookie makes feel weird). I'm finding it so hard to become myself again and to let myself out like I use to and being able to eat during the day without remorse but the fear of getting fat keeps taking over (not so much as it used to though). My parents have told me that they'd get me a therapist to help me dealing with all of these. I agree with them. There is a lot I'd like to talk and explore. But I keep delaying it because I fear going back to normal, despite understanding how much help I need. Right now I'm also too sensitive and just reading about calories, how many I can eat in a day, "good foods" vs "bad foods",..., it all makes me tingle and gives me anxiety.

I think I know exactly what I need to do, but I just can't do it. There's this "me" in me that doesn't let me be me. Why did I even began worrying so much about food out of nowhere in the first place?

It snowed here yesterday and all the schools and even some universities are closed. I want pizza and don’t want to drive for it, but I also don’t want to be an asshole. For the pizza drivers out there, does a good tip make up for snowy conditions? And how much would a “good tip” be?










I did some digging around but can't seem to find an answer to this question anywhere.  Here's the situation.... in my home lab I have two hosts backed by NFS storage with no local disks.  Every time I want to upgrade or mess around with the NAS I have got to take everything in the house down which is a bit of a pain.   I was thinking about adding local storage to one of the boxes so I could just vMotion all the "critical" things off and keep them up while the NAS is down but adding vSAN seems like it would be a better option if possible.  Here's the catch, the servers are all pizza boxes and only have one drive bay in them.  My thought would be to grab a 1-2TB SSD drive for each server and set it up as an all flash disk group but I don't know if that's possible and would rather find out before sinking the $$$ into the drives.  Barring that the only other option I can think of (other than getting creative with zip ties) would be to add a SATDOM as the cache disk but that seems like quite the waste for what I'm trying to do.

Obviously this is all home lab stuff and I'm not overly concerned with the performance or redundancy.  Sure it would be nice but if everything goes b00m it would be just as much fun to rebuild it from the ground up.  It probably needs it anyways ;)

Any guidance would be most appreciated.
I've done what feels like the last delivery and have got to go in the shelter but I'm just shy of 5 stars. Is it possible to max out and if so, how?

I want to make a breakfast pizza which basically consists of the base (dough), eggs, and sausage+bacon+cheese. I don't have a recipe yet...

**BAKERS PERCENTAGES**

Baker's percentage is a notation method indicating the proportion of an ingredient relative to the flour used in a recipe when making bread, cakes, muffins, and other baked goods. It is also referred to as baker's math, and may be indicated by a phrase such as based on flour weight. It is sometimes called formula percentage, a phrase that refers to the sum of a set of bakers' percentages. Baker's percentage expresses a ratio in percentages of each ingredient's weight to the total flour weight:

**Baker's Percentage** *ingredient* = 100% x (**Weight** *ingredient* / **Weight** *flour*)

For example, in a recipe that calls for 1666 grams of flour and 1000 grams of water, the corresponding baker's percentages are 100% for the flour and 60% for the water. Because these percentages are stated with respect to the weight of flour rather than with respect to the weight of all ingredients, the sum of these percentages always exceeds 100%.

Flour-based recipes are more precisely conceived as baker's percentages, and more accurately measured using weight instead of volume. The uncertainty in using volume measurements follows from the fact that flour settles in storage and therefore does not have a constant density.

&amp;#x200B;

|Ingredient|Baker's-%|
|:-|:-|
|Flour|100%|
|Water|60%|
|Salt|3%|
|Fresh Yeast|0,3%|
I make pretty basic pizza, usually the pre-made ones you just put in the oven or pita, tomato sauce and cheese.
Which plate would be best for making these kinds of pizza? I know there are much better ones made especially for pizza, but I don't want to buy them really.
So which plate should I be using? The full metal one? Or the one with the vertical metal lines? (I use a toaster oven BTW)



Some things like soup or fries just don't really taste well when they are cold. Pizza on the other hand tastes good even when it is cold. Is there any scientific reason why that is?


Hello everyone!

Let's try this again! Still looking for people to be friends with. English is not my main language, so I am sorry for any grammar errors you might find.

A little bit about myself then: I'm 22 and from Portugal. I tend to be a bit shy IRL at first but once I get comfortable with someone, that shyness goes away. I am a developer/programmer (yeah I know, what can I do, I like to suffer) and have been working for the past year in that area of business.

I just moved in with my girlfriend of 6 years, at the start of this week and I am currently experiencing how hard it is to schedule house tasks with work.

I'm a big fan of dark and dad jokes and will probably use them as I see fit! :P I am also a good listener (in this case, reader?) and love a good discussion on the most random topics (fan of AITA subreddit, so we can discuss that as well).

When I have free time I enjoy playing PS4, playing some mobile games or League of Legends on my computer (it rarely happens nowadays though). I also enjoy watching anime (also rare now), tv series and movies, which now happens more with my girlfriend than when alone. I am a big reddit user as it is my go-to when bored.

What I don't enjoy:

* Most sports (with the exception of Tennis and Snooker, if you call it a sport);

* Polytics (although I wish to learn more about it and develop my knowledge on the subject);

* Celebrity gossip;

* Pineapple on pizza (just no.);

* Cats (those little devils... Also I'm allergic to them).
What I am looking for is someone who I can talk with on a daily basis, about the weather, our day, what's on our mind or just other random things. Basically anything.

Really not sure on what else to say other than I am surprised you're still reading.

If you are interested in getting to know me better and maybe start a new friendship, feel free to PM me with your favorite colour in the subject! I am also open to using other chat methods!
Hey there. I have this girl that I have gotten really close to over the past few months. She is really, really great but I am trying to give her some space because she has some stuff she wants to figure out. So, that is why I am making this post. I am looking for another girl I can talk to and laugh with while letting her sort of have some alone time. I'll tell you a bit about me too:

- I am a scuba diving instructor.

- I LOVE animals.

- I have been craving pizza nonstop for the past month. Lol.

- I once made and drank my own wine when I was 14 and it was the worst, most painful thing I'd ever done.

- Also, I once stole the pregnancy belly from the home economics room in high school and wore it around. When the teachers tried to take it away from me for disturbing classes I screamed, "That's my baby! Don't take my baby!"

Haha. That's enough. You'll learn more about me when we talk.

Also, yes, I am a guy online asking for a clean chat. I know that seems unlikely but I really don't want any temptations because this other girl means a lot to me. I am strictly looking for a friend.

Interesting article. 

Seems odd to sacrifice the prime of your life (20's and 30's) when you should be really enjoying life.

"Lisa Harrison sacrificed weekly coffee dates and Friday pizza nights after marrying her husband to stick to their 70% savings rate. She also let go of her aspirations of buying a home in the suburbs two months in advance of her wedding to save for that special day."

"The sacrifices you must make, such as turning down weddings or skipping date night, may end up eroding the happiness you experience now."

I hate cheese so I never got to eat Pizza because of that. Sometimes it's weird for me when I'm around people glowing about their love for Pizza and I'm like, is there something wrong with me? I have thought of trying it but cheese is the kind of food I get nauseous just by thinking about taking a bite. I always had this distaste for cheese because it tastes like vomit.
I'll try to make this short. 

I have been with a girl for 6 years (she was sick, she had dyssomnia, and was coughing until puking sometimes when she catched a cold)

i was at school when we met each other, but she wasn't a classmate. 
She was working at the school library and was 10 years older than me. (i was 16 years old and she was 26) we were seeing each other on the evening or on the week end, and when we were sawing each other at school we were acting like strangers Who didn't know each other. It was so fucking exciting having this situation of secret lovers and we told anybody about this because we were scared that she could be fired for a such thing. 

Anyway, one year later i quit school and this sens of forbidden was slowly fading away. But we continued to see each other and loving each other. 

Years pass, a lot of things happen, we nearly Never argue (2-3 times in 6 years for shitty reasons) 

I found a job as a gardener and it was a pretty shitty job that was clearly stressing me out and making me in a bad mood even really angry sometimes (i Never insulted her or hitted her i would Never do this). 
I worked all this summer and she had school vacation so she was most of the time at her appartement because she was feeling "dizzy". And i didn't wanted to come home to see her blaming herself and don't be able to have sex with her... 

But i took her for granted (maybe because i though that she was sick and Never would be able to leave me and find someone else, yeah i know it's a really horrible way to think but i digust myself Today.)

For the 2 past month of the breakup we didn't had sex because she was "feeling too dizzy about her illness and the medication that she takes down her libido" 
So i told myself that i wouln't push her to do things if she wasn't feeling well. 

And because of this lack of sex, we slowly got each other away one from the other. Less and Less i love you, i wasn't going to see her often. And there come our 6 years anniversary, we ate pizza like it was not a special Day, i don't even remember saying to her i love you and her telling me this too. 
She blowed me but we didn't had sex. 

5 days after our 6 years she dumps me because "i love you but i'm not in love with you" 
I begged and pleadded for 2 weeks. 
And i asked her if she met someone else and she said no. 

So 2 week after the break up i asked her to see her and I asked her to remove her sunglassed and tell me that there were not someone else while looking in each others eyes. 
She told me that she met someone but she didn't cheat on me because "he asked for my number but i didn't give him, he gave me his number and i contacted him after. (when she told me that i knew that they were talking way before our relashionship ends but i didn't say anything because i called her Mother and her mother said to me it's True that she didn't make the thing in the good way so i knew they were talking before she dumped me.) I said that if it didn't work with the other Guy she could come back to me (big mistake i know now haha) 

The fact is even after the break up she still reached out to me asking how i was and asking things about my life and sending me pictures about what was happening in her life. 
I got pretty tired about it because she dumped me but she was the one reaching out and i couldn't make the no contact rule if she wasn't experiencing the loss. So oneday she reached out and i asked her if we could  catch each other to eat something at her place. She agreed. 

I came at her place, i saw a New toothbrush and a New Phone charger where i used to sleep on the other side of the bed. (that's about 1 month after the breakup) 
I knew a this moment that he (maybe) was already installed at her place. It  broke my heart but i didn't say anything. 
We engaged a discussion, and i tried to kiss her, she rejected me (i told myself that i had nothing to lose lmao) 
And she apoligized because she didn't though that i came for this. (lmao she though that i came to play some chess or what) 
And i asked her if she sawed me as a Friend, she said : at the moment yes, a really good friend. 

I thanked her for this offer that touches me but i refused to be her friend. 
She cried and said that she understood why. 
She asked if she could come time to time ask for news in my life and i said that it was better not. 
She said that i could come ask her how she was doing time to time and i said that i don't think i Will. 
But i said that if she Changed her mind she could contact me and we could get back together or try to make things work. 
I don't really remember what she said but she didn't say no to that, it was a blurry response. 

Then i was about to leave her place while she was still crying, she said take care of yourself. 
I said i hope you'll get better with your health problems and i leaved. 

I Just wanted you're advice about this situation because it's a really special one.
I really love her, i do, and i regret tooking her for granted, and i told her in the beggining of the breakup that i would do anything possible to be a better person. 

Even if she leaved me for someone else i still care for her and i know that she care for me too.

She really seemed desesperate when i said that i refused her friendship. But she could come back if she Changed her mind. 

Do you think there is a possibility that she'll Come back ?

I took care of her for 5 years, by the end of the relationship i had exams and a lot of stress with a lot of work that's also why i didn't see her as often  as the old days. 

She broke up with me september 17 and i'm in no contact since october 23 because she was still reaching out every 3-4 days to ask how i was doing. 

What are your thoughts about the situation ?

(sorry english isn't my native language)
 **What is there to do on Maui?**  

Hey, aloha. Everybody, it's Adam Miller with the Nine Times Network coming to you from the beautiful island of Maui. 

So today I wanted to do a quick video and talk to you about something that was probably the number one question that we were asked before moving to Maui:  Aren't you going to get bored living on an island?  So I'm here to tell you that this is far from true. Well, it is an island - we are just not going to get bored here.

So besides golfing, fishing, paddle boarding, and surfing, there so much to do here.   You can go zip-lining, whale watching. You know that there are actually multiple microbrews here. There is a winery; you could go on a vodka and a rum tour.   So I just wanted to give you a little update on what we're doing this weekend. 

  


https://preview.redd.it/sahvc0ecmay31.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3baf6c316c4ecd1e3f69382f5249c176a81c43b7

So let me give you a low down of what we're doing this weekend. It's Friday. Happy. Aloha Friday.

And so tonight we, started a foodie meet up group and we're meeting at the Maui brewing company in Kihei.   They have fantastic food. The views are unbelievable.

And they have a massive selection of beer. They're starting to make their own spirits as well. That's pretty cool.

So that's Friday night. Saturday morning, we are actually having a booth at the Maui swap meet.

Even when we don't have a booth at the swap meet, we go to the swap meet every week.

It happens every Saturday, 7 a. M. To 1 p. M.  It's one fantastic place to get your knick-knacks and your souvenirs.

It's also probably the best place on island, in my opinion, to get your fruits and vegetables, which is why we go every week.   So,, that's Saturday daytime.

Saturday night time. We're going to see some live music. That was definitely my big concern because I love live music. I have seen lots and lots of concerts, hundreds of concerts, actually.

There is an exorbitant amount of live music here, and tomorrow we're headed to charlie's in Paia, and we're super excited about that. Charlie's is a fantastic place. They have terrific food.

They also have a lot of live music. So if you're on island whether you are visiting here or you are, a resident here, go support Charlies. They have great food and I love their pizza and they actually have the best cauliflower bites on island.

So that is a full day for Saturday. And then, of course, Sunday we're going to do an open house.

We're also going to be fishing. Then we're headed back to the Maui Brewing Company because they're having what they call the Pog fest.

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/dvdgc5/video/xafy9749may31/player

If you're on island you should definitely check this out. I believe it is 3 to 10 o'clock Sunday night. Pog so you know stands for passion fruit, orange, guava.

They have a whole assortment of beer that they are brewing made with Pog. I know they have a Pog Sour they have a Pog IPA. So we're super excited about that.

So that is a full weekend. So there is definitely lots to do. Check out our website [**NineTimesNetwork.com.**](https://ninetimesnetwork.com/) We've got a list of other things to do on island.

And of course, if you need help planning your vacation or cool things to do, you can check out our [**youtube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6CB5hfV4tS8Ug2FJVnf68w) or give me a call.

808-866-6606. I appreciate it. Make it a great day.
