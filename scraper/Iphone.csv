Review: Microsoft Cortana reading email aloud on an iPhone is surprisingly useful, to a point https://t.co/ffvpRuYFX0 https://t.co/9O84a3ZK59




Hello! So we are a little unsure on what to do in this situation. My sister lost her iPhone on holiday in Ibiza, and now back home in UK. The Find My app the next day showed that the phone was offline, Lost Mode etc was immediately switched on, and my own telephone number. It has been pending since.

About a month later, we receive a strange phone call from a man in Uganda stating that he has bought an iPhone (same model as my sister that went missing) from someone who he thought was a friend, but it is locked to my sister's iCloud account. It seems like he retrieved her phone number from her iCloud details. He stated that he has tried to return the iPhone to his 'friend' but he refuses to take it back, claiming that it is definitely HIS iPhone but he has forgotten the details of the iCloud account (even though it's my sisters details), and some other excuse to avoid him. He doesn't seem happy and has even forwarded photos and facebook account screenshots of this person to show who he is.

He has not explicitly asked us for anything, and sounds like he is unsure what to do himself. He said the phone is useless to him, he wants his money back but can't seem to get it, but also appreciates it belongs to my sister and seems interested in helping. The only thing he has suggested is handing it over to the UK embassy in Uganda.

We are currently in touch with him via messaging but aren't sure what to do! We really want the phone back as it's a recent model and just over a month old. But not sure what is the best way forward in this situation. I can't tell whether this is all truth or not either, but he seems genuine as he's not asking for money or anything. Of course trusting the guy to send it to us is difficult too, not that he has agreed to that yet anyway.

Can anyone please advise what we can do? Report to Apple? Police? Get involved with the embassy?
How to get around that when iphone keeps asking to certified the ispoofer app on a day to day basis, how to get around that, anyone know.

Hey! It's Rich, maker of [Failory](https://www.failory.com), the site where we weekly publish interviews with failed startup founders.

A few weeks ago we published an interview with Matt Volm, who co-founded a technology startup called Tali. They raised over $750,000 and ran the company for 2.5 years. Yet, they were never able to find product-market fit and had to shut down.

👇 Here's the full story:

&amp;nbsp;

*****


##### Hi Matt! What's your background, and what are you currently working on?  

Hey there - My name I Matt Volm. I’m currently 33 years old, a dad to two young boys, and the former CEO and Co-Founder of a now-defunct VC-backed technology startup called [Tali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-J4CRQbfVg&amp;feature=youtu.be).   

Tali was a timekeeping solution for lawyers powered by voice technology like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. With Tali, you could record your time via voice (“hey Alexa, tell Tali to log 12 minutes to the Hanson divorce matter”), and Tali would take what you said and turn it into a time entry form that you could sync to your existing billing system. Tali was a SaaS product, so users could purchase a monthly subscription ($12/user per month) or an annual subscription ($120/user per year). We raised nearly $1.0M of venture capital to fund the business and ran the company for nearly 2.5 years, but ultimately wound things down due to lack of product-market fit.

&amp;nbsp;

##### What motivated you to start Tali?

I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin and was the first person in my family to go to college. I focused on accounting and finance, and my first job out of school was as a CPA. I only lasted a few years as a CPA, and then moved into corporate finance, which I did for a few years as well before going to graduate school, attending Berkeley Haas School of Business and getting my MBA. After my MBA, I did management consulting for a few years, but ultimately went back into corporate finance, which is what I was doing before starting Tali. 

As you can see, my career path has been rather meandering and includes a variety of experiences. I always thought that starting a company would be fun, but had no clue how it was actually done. Tali was my first startup, so before starting the company I had no idea how entrepreneurs came up with ideas for their startups. I thought you had to be an engineer, ultimately solving some very difficult problems with a complicated piece of technology. Turns out, I was wrong. 

The idea for Tali all started one night in my dining room. My wife is an attorney, so needs to track every six-minute increments of her day in order to appropriately bill her time. She tracks all of her time using pen and paper, and will then spend a few hours each week at our dining room table manually entering this data into her electronic time and billing system. I saw her doing this one evening as I was setting a timer with our newly purchased Amazon Echo, so I randomly threw out the idea “hey, wouldn’t it be great if you could just tell Alexa to track your time for you, and she would turn it into a time entry form?”

My wife thought it was a decent idea, so I went out and spoke to as many other attorneys as I could. I learned that they had the same problem around timekeeping, and thought a voice application through Amazon Alexa would be a novel way to solve their problems. After this initial customer discovery, I thought the idea had some weight, so went to form a team around it. 

&amp;nbsp;

##### How did you build it?

While the idea for Tali may have been sparked in my dining room, it didn’t get it's true start until one random afternoon a few weeks later. At the time, I was working in Strategic Finance at HealthSparq, a healthcare technology company in Portland, Oregon. It was here that I met two other guys named Matt — Matt Anthes-Washburn, or “AW”, was a product manager and Matt Hoiland, or “Hoi”, was a full-stack dev.

During a hackathon at HealthSparq, Hoi and AW had created a chatbot named Charli that would answer all of your health insurance questions based on your specific member benefits (I know, pretty awesome, right?). The ease of the conversational user interface attracted me to this project, and it was our joint passion for conversational UI that initially brought us together.

As a non-technical person, I had no idea how any of this stuff worked. To be honest, I was pretty ignorant when it came to technology and just took for granted that stuff like my iPhone did what I needed it to do. But I wanted to learn more about how Charli worked, and also how something like this Alexa time tracking solution would work. So I asked them to meet up after work one day, and I quote, “teach me how AI works” — such a simple request, right?

After we got together, Hoi and AW ran through some basics associated with AI in a way that a non-technical person like me could grasp. Then I told them about the problem my wife was having, and the proposed solution I had recommended. Before I even finished my sentence, Hoi was penciling stuff out on paper on how that could work, meanwhile AW was doing what AW ultimately does best — teaching me what Hoi was penciling out, how it would all work, and what it would mean for a potential user like my wife.

Within 30 minutes we had a proof of concept sketched out, and I was convinced that we had something special — not necessarily in the form of a product (although I certainly hoped that would be the case), but in the form of a team.

You had me, the business Matt.

You had AW, the product Matt.

And you had Hoi, the technical Matt.

So the next weekend, over donuts and blueberry pancakes at AW’s house, we decided to make it official — we were going to start a company together.

Idea? ✔️ Team? ✔️ Product concept? ✔️ Funding? Nope.

One of the benefits (and pitfalls) I had as a first-time founder was naivety. Once you have an idea and a team, all you need is a pitch deck and you can go out and raise some money, right? That’s what I thought, and so that’s what I did.

Hoi (the technical Matt) is not only an all-around coding ninja, but he’s also a top-notch designer and creator. He shot a high level product demo and some other footage, which he edited into a professional-looking 60 second video that I could share with investors ([click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-J4CRQbfVg&amp;feature=youtu.be) to see this original video). In addition, I prepared a [15 slide pitch deck](https://www.notion.so/mattvolm/The-First-Tali-Slide-Deck-53519671f73340d395fe1b74e0321193) outlining what we were trying to build at Tali. With these two things, I started sending every early-stage VC a cold email asking for a meeting. The response rate was, in one word… *sigh* underwhelming.

This isn’t surprising — I was a first-time founder, we were pre-revenue and had nothing more than a product idea and a team that I *thought* could build it.

But then we experienced our first bit of good luck…I got a response from an early-stage VC out of Los Angeles and we scheduled a phone call. I spoke to one partner for an hour, and he then referred me to his other partner, who I spoke with a few days later. Two phone calls with two people a few days apart.

I got a term sheet the next week.

They wired me $150k the following week.

All of this without ever meeting in person, just two phone calls…this fundraising thing isn’t so bad, eh?

Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong wrong. Turns out fundraising was a giant pain in the a$$, and I heard “no” more often than I heard “yes”. I’m not going to get into fundraising here, but we ultimately went on to raise ~$750k in total to fund the business (round was rolling, so we collected one check at a time from a variety of investors over the ~2.5yrs we were in business), but this first check and investor is what made all of that possible.

We started the company in February 2017, received our first investment in June 2017, and launched our paid beta product in September 2017, six months after we initially got started.

In terms of actually building the product, my two co-founders (e.g. Product Matt and Technical Matt) did nearly all of the work (we did use some contractors as well, who were close friends, so we knew their work was quality). We considered outsourcing some development work but ultimately determined that managing an offshore development team would be more time consuming and actually give us less control over the product and codebase then we wanted.

Our strategy at Tali was to get a paid product into market as quickly as we possibly could. We wanted to do this for two reasons:

- Technology risk — we wanted to prove that our solution could work end to end, meaning you could log your billable time with Amazon Alexa and get that time entry into your billing or invoicing system, all without manually filling out a time entry form and
- Market risk — we wanted to prove that people would be willing to pay for this type of solution

On the front-end or input side, we started with a focus solely on Amazon Alexa (we later added Google Assistant). In addition, we built a simple web application that a user could access online to see all of the time entries they captured with Tali (we called this the Tali dashboard). Last but not least, on the invoicing side we started with an integration approach — rather than build our own invoicing and billing system (which would require a lot of engineering effort and take time), we chose to integrate with Clio, a legal practice management solutions (we later added PracticePantherand Rocket Matteras integration partners as well).

We went to the market at a price point of $90 for a three month subscription (or $30 per month). This price point was higher than our competitors, but we didn’t focus on this — instead, we looked at the value we were delivering to our user. If a lawyer bills out at $300/hr then each six-minute increment of their day is worth $30…surely Tali could save you more than six minutes over the course of a month! We included a free Echo Dot to sweeten the deal for our customers, but also to avoid the objection of “I don’t have a smart speaker for my office so I can’t use this software.”

This product — the Amazon Alexa skill, the Tali dashboard, and the Clio integration — priced at $90 for a three-month subscription (with a free Echo Dot) is what we launched in September 2017 at the Clio Cloud Conference in New Orleans…and people loved it! 💜

By December 2017, our paid user base had risen to 101 people from all across the globe. At $30/month, that’s $3,030 of monthly recurring revenue (MRR)…not bad for a product built mostly on nights and weekends by a team of three!

We launched, and then we realized we had a problem.

When a user created an account and submitted their credit card information for a $90 purchase, which got them three months of Tali, they were making a unique, one-time purchase.

We never built in the functionality for the subscription to automatically renew. 🤦‍♂️

This meant that everyone who had signed up would need to submit their credit card information AGAIN, or a second time to keep their Tali subscription going.

You’re probably cringing right now, which is the appropriate response. This meant I had to reach out to every person, all 101 people, to ask them to submit their credit card information again.

I e-mailed 📧

I called ☎️

I e-mailed again 📧

I called again ☎️

After all was said and done, I managed to get 22 people to submit their credit card information again. Let me do the math for you — that’s a 78% churn rate…ouch. 😟

&amp;nbsp;

##### Which were your marketing strategies to grow your business?

We tried everything - inside sales, Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, reseller arrangements, etc. etc. - but nothing ended up working. Near the end of Tali, sales were slow and only growing about 10%-15% per month. We reached about $3,000 of monthly recurring revenue (MRR) but nothing we did on the sales and marketing side seemed to move the needle. 

This was mostly driven by our target customer, which was a solo or small firm attorney. Because of this, account sizes were typically small (less than 10 users) and our price was also low ($10 - 12 per user per month), meaning our average revenue per account was $100 or less. This meant we couldn’t afford to spend a lot of money to land these smaller accounts in a profitable way, and we never ended up figuring out an efficient way to spend our sales and marketing dollars in a way that generated favorable unit economics (e.g. customer acquisition cost when compared to customer lifetime value). 

&amp;nbsp;

##### Which were the causes of Tali failure?

We had some hiccups early on, every startup does, but we continued to grind away throughout 2018, and what a grind it was.

During 2018, we focused heavily on improving the product. Everything we did had a positive impact on user experience and engagement, but nothing really moved the needle. Our average daily active users (DAU) crept up, but was never greater than 10% of our total paid user base. We were able to get a lot more people activated because of the onboarding improvements AW and Hoi made, but our free trial to paid conversion rate (those users that started with a free 30-day trial and then converted to a paid subscriber) never rose above 3.0%.

We were growing our paid user base each month, but growth was slow (only 10% — 15%) and driven mostly by direct sales efforts (which meant unsustainable unit economics). We even reduced the price from $30/user/month to $12/user/month to see if this would help drive sales, but it didn’t. We ended 2018 with around 250 paid users, more than we had at the end of 2017, but because of our price reduction, our MRR remained flat at roughly $3k.

By December 2018 I knew we were in trouble. At this point, I had raised nearly $1.0M and we had 2.5 months of runway left.

I went to our current investors to ask for another follow on, and they all said no.

I tried to find angel investors that would write some smaller checks, and they all said no.

I even tried to find some later-stage investors that would write a larger check, but they all said no too.

We weren’t going to grow our way out of this problem, and we weren’t going get additional capital either, which left us with two options — put things in cruise control or zombie mode, or shut things down.

I think the most difficult part in this process was simply admitting the fact that shutting things down was an option. As an entrepreneur, you need to solve your way out of a lot of problems and the odds are always stacked against you. So how do you know if this is just another one of those things you need to plow through, or if it’s different? Here’s what I did.

**Talk to your mentors**

My initial thought was we would just put things on hold at Tali for a while until we figured out what was next. We’d keep the technology up and running, do support requests and demos as needed, but would otherwise do as little as needed to keep the lights on. Me and my team would go and get day jobs to pay our bills, and once we “turned the corner” with Tali we would jump back in full time. Sounds like a great plan, right?  

**Turns out, not so much.**

I wasn’t able to admit that shutting things down was an option until I spoke to two of my mentors. Both had founded multiple companies in their lifetimes, some succeeded but most failed. They gave me the same advice — putting things in zombie mode is a dumb idea. “Give this thing everything you have over the next few weeks, and you’ll either go out in a blaze of glory or you’ll turn things around. Anything in between is not a viable option.”  

With these conversations, zombie mode was off the table, and we were either going to turn things around or shut things down. Because of these conversations, I was finally able to admit shutting down was an option, and actually say the words out loud. Doing this was incredibly freeing, and took a huge weight off my chest.

**Consider and reflect on everything you’ve done**

After I spoke to my mentors, I went to the drawing board to reflect on everything we did up to that point and asked myself “is there anything I’m missing or anything I haven’t tried?” I looked at this mostly through the lens of our go-to-market and growth strategy, but also considered our product approach.

I tried outbound sales, but unit economics were not sustainable.

I tried digital marketing, but the results were poor.

I tried Google Adwords and SEM, but this was expensive and conversion rates were low.

I put reseller agreements in place with technology partners, but these weren’t driving any volume.

Blogging, webinars, etc. all produced the same results — nothing seemed to be working.

I even went to other startup founders, asking them if they had any recommendations or tactics I could try. All of their ideas were things I had already experimented with, which didn’t yield positive results.

Then I looked at the numbers and realized that, at our average growth rate, it would take us 26 months to reach cash flow positive at our current burn rate. How on earth would we even make that happen if we got day jobs and were focusing LESS on the business?

**Is a “one-step” pivot viable?**

By “one-step pivot”, I mean keeping one foot planted on the ground while lifting the other and moving it in a different direction (versus a two-step pivot of lifting both feet off the ground and completely jumping in a different direction).

Up to this point, our strategy was to be a horizontal SaaS company, one that was building a time and billing solution that could enter other industries outside of legal, rather than building a vertical SaaS solution just for attorneys. However, since we launched our product we had a long list of feature requests from our attorney users that were not focused on time and billing — things like taking notes, adding calendar entries, and assigning tasks, to name a few.

We hadn’t prioritized these legal-specific things before, but could we build and launch any of them within the timeframe we had left? It sounded like a one-step pivot — we were still focused on voice technology for our existing core user but would expand our use case to go beyond time and deep within legal (something we hadn’t previously planned).

Turns out this wasn’t a viable option, at least not with the time (or money) we had left. Are there any options left?

**Can you sell?**

We had spent nearly $1.0M and the last two years of our time building Tali. We had built a voice technology application for a business that worked, something we believed (and still believe) will be core to future enterprise software products. So we asked ourselves — “would anyone want to buy what we’ve built?”

We had a few conversations, but nothing that ended up working out.

**No more options**

After I went through all of the options above, there was only one thing left — winding down. So that’s what we did — our attorneys started the legal process, and I notified all of our investors, partners, and users to tell them that we’d be shutting down, and then closed the bank accounts.

&amp;nbsp;

##### Which were your biggest mistakes and challenges you had to overcome?  

We were first-time founders, so everything was brand new to us. We had never raised venture capital before, built a product from scratch, or tested sales and marketing techniques, along with a whole lot more. While this was a significant challenge we had to overcome, it also helped us throughout our journey - we had no preconceived notion of how things were supposed to be done, no bias from our past experiences. 

&amp;nbsp;

##### Which were your expenses? Did you achieve some revenue? In the end, how much money did you lose?

We ran Tali for nearly 2.5 years and spent about $750k during that time (most of our spend was spent on salaries/labor, marketing, and travel) We did have a revenue generating product, but were only generating ~$3.0k of MRR at the time we wound things down. 

&amp;nbsp;

##### If you had to start over, what would you do differently?

Two things:

1. I would have run more experiments in verticals outside of legal, such as accounting and consulting, which also have a pain point around timekeeping. This could have given us the option to pivot and focus on a different industry with potentially more growth potential and initial traction. 
2. I would have focused less on voice technology as the core of our product. Ultimately, our product was not able to meet the expectations of our users because the voice technology we were leveraging just wasn’t where we needed it to be so we could be successful. If we would have coupled voice technology where it made sense with an improved visual and on-screen UI/UX I think we would’ve been successful. 

‍&amp;nbsp;

##### Which are your favorite entrepreneurial resources?

People. Hands down, the best resources an entrepreneur can have are the people they surround themselves with. I do my best to constantly expand my network, leveraging tools like Twitter, LinkedIn and e-mail to reach out to people (typically cold outreach) I want to meet.

Me and my partner have been in scene for 20+ years. Have been to every major festival multiple, multiple times across the world. Have been to events where there are ring leaders leading groups of “workers” directing and pointing to who they should steal phones from. Have literally gotten into a tug of war with a thief to get my phone back once. In spite of all of this, have never had a phone stolen successfully, however twice had a phone returned that was either inadvertently dropped or attempted to be stolen. My advice for whatever it is worth:

1) Situational awareness. If you are out of your head and bring your iPhone XR 11, display it freely, you are an attractive target. If you are going to do this, bring a phone you do not care about.

2) Set the lock screen wallpaper to display a message to call another phone of a friend if phone is lost or is recovered after theft. The police after EDCO literally have 30+ phones they do not know who owns right now.

3) Keep your phone tethered to you or your fanny pack, and secure, in front of you, in a zippered fashion.

4) My backpack is loaded with led lights and flashing lights both inside and out. It looks pretty good. And if someone were to take it, they would be very easily seen and get the crap beat out of them before they get 5 feet. I also actually bring some cable ties as we like to be on front rail and will cable tie it to fence if we will be there for hours in same spot. I bring a small nail clipper to cut cable tie later. Okay overkill but whatever.

5) Always do backups frequently in worse case scenarios.

Sure maybe we are lucky overall, but I certainly believe if a harder target, the thieves will look somewhere easier. These people suck and are parasites, but this is the way it is.



Check your iphones. release feels really clean compared o the desktop release. get fired up!!



I recently bought a new phone after having the tiny IPhone 5s for like 8 years and I would simply throw it in my left front pants pocket. I only just realized the problem that this would entail when I instinctively slammed my XR into my pocket which made my phone crash into my erect shaft thus causing me some slight pain and discomfort. I already sort of missed my tiny phone but now have more reason. Love you guys and girls.


Hello all,

This morning, I updated checkra1n 0.9.1 iPhone X running iOS 13.2.2 to checkra1n 0.9.2. When booting, the screen did not initially work. Not responsive, but the buttons worked. I went back into DFU mode, and rejailbroke. After booting up, I received a prompt saying FaceID could not be activated. I went into Settings &gt; FaceID and I Reset FaceID. I went back into DFU mode and rejailbroke, in which FaceID worked again. Due to the instability of this beta, it froze and automatically restarted. I now am debating on going back to 0.9.1 or 0.9. I have seen many people go back to 0.9.

Best of luck to anyone running the new version of checkra1n  
   
&amp;nbsp;

Extra info:

A week ago, I was on iOS 12.4 running unc0ver. I used the Restore RootFS and Cleared Icon Cache. The operation went smoothly. This was the first time I have used Restore RootFS. I jailbroke on 12.4 with checkra1n, booted into "Non-Jailbreak Mode" and updated my iPhone to iOS 13.2.2. Prior to 12.4 I used "Restore iPhone" in iTunes

Currently running OSX 10.15.1

Owner of both a XS Max and 11 Pro Max. Anyone else buying a X for Checkra1n? Interested to hear everyone’s thoughts. 

I’m thinking on buying a refurbished model from Craigslist today.

Now, as a person who once only smoked weed, I remember two things. First, I didn't know much at the time about anything to do with other drugs. Second, weed makes food fucking heavenly. I hope the following report of my  conducted experiment educates you on some of the struggles that are experienced with purifying other drugs, whilst also motivating you to get up and cook that chicken that I know will satisfy your munchies. Without further ado, enjoy:

Acetone washing is a harm reduction technique applicable to many substances including meth, amphetamine, cocaine, and more. 

In addition to purifying the drugs you plan to consume, acetone washing is also helpful in evaluating the overall quaity of a product as a whole. This is done by weighing the drugs before acetone washing, and then again after the wash is complete, to see how much weight in impurities were lost in the process. 

Alas, even an acetone wash is not necessarily a litmus test for evaluating drug quality/purity since impurities can also be added to your amphetamine or meth, for instance, that aren't soluble in acetone, and therefore will not be removed by an acetone wash.

Impurities in chicken breasts, on the other hand, are not of nearly as much concern as black market narcotics; unless you happen to be one of those anti GMO/Hormone/Caged/Waterboarding faggots. Like it's my fault waterboarding a chicken for 40 seconds before it's beheaded relelases hormones in the body that make it taste better. Fuck you.

As some of you may know; air-frying is all the rage right now. And since Sunday is meal-prep day anyway, I've decided to apply our acetone-wash-weight-test to different methods of cooking skinless chicken breasts. I'm going to weigh 4 chicken breasts, then cook them all to precisely 165 degrees farenheit using different methods and see which one removes the most weight from a skinless chicken breast.

The 4 methods of cooking will be air-fried, oven-baked, grilled, and boiled. 

Unfortunately, the only scale I have has a maximum weight capacity of like 30 grams, so actually weighing each chicken breast is out of the question. This means we'll have to eyeball it. I'll take before and after pictures of the chicken breasts that you can evaluate yourselves later on.

Now, the first concern of any Drug Enthusiast is OpSec, so I need to photograph and label these chicken breasts in a way that can't be traced back to me. This goes much, much further than snapping a shot and wiping the metadata. Intelligence Agencies can gleen a plethora of information from even the most insignificant details in a photo. The style of table, the type of wood on a floor, the paint color on the walls. All these things can be used to narrow down an agent's list of suspects who could possibly be you. 

Even imperfections in a few of the millions of pixels modern cameras capture can be uniquely attributed to your device retroactively.

This means, ideally, I would acquire a device capable of taking pictures annonymously for one-time use. The iphone I snagged from some alcoholic's back pocket at a bar a little while back, for instance; which I will use for the photos in this experiment, and then destroy beyond recognition. Bars are a great place to steal phones because drunks lose them at bars all the time anyway and will be much less suspicious that it was stolen in that scenario, especially if they are hammered.

I need to cover the table with something also but what? At first I thought looseleaf paper should be ok but then remembered an article I read about how all printer paper bears marks imperceptible to the eye that can indicate when it was made and where it was sent. If printer paper bears such marks, it stands to reason that looseleaf these days may as well. 

I have some old cardboard ringbinder folders that I could lay out, but they are so old, I wonder how many people could possibly have these particular ring-binder folders in such mint condition. I could burn them after I'm done, but they really don't make em' like this anymore...

Paper Towels, I wonder. But what if the designs on rolls of paper towels, like the imperceptible markings of printer paper, also bear tiny imperfections that can be correlated back to where/when that particular roll of paper towels was manufactured and shipped to? Too risky. 

In fact, it seems there's nothing in my home that I could take a picture of this chicken on top of that couldn't be potentially traced back to me. 

I decide to go out and make a cash purchase of some graph paper. Graph paper will also make it easier to eyeball each chicken breast after it's cooked anyway, so win-win. First, I walk into town and find a homeless person. I tell him I'll pay him ten bucks to drive the next town or so over with me and buy me some graph paper. He agrees. We walk to my car, which I've parked about a 1/2 mile from my place, and head out. Needless to say, my cellphone is left at home duct taped to my cat.

The homeless guy and I get 50 or so miles out to the edge of some town, then stop in a secluded spot and pull the bicycles out of my trunk, we ride the bikes into town and find a General Store. We ride about a mile away from the general store, and then I have the homeless guy walk back to get the graph paper. He returns. There's trouble. He bought sandpaper. 

Turns out this homeless person, nor the next one, even know what graph paper is. Third times a charm: Homeless Mitch pulls through, regaling me with opprobrious tales of a derelict nature along the way. He says he used to own clydesdales and insists the American vagabond is dead. 

I don't realise I'm out of cash and there can't be more than $1.50 left in Homeless Mitch's pocket until he's already brought me the graph paper, so I drive us back, put a glock in his face and tell him to get the fuck out of my car. Sorry Homeless Mitch, nothing personal. Your vagrant peers are to blame.

Finally I get back with the graph paper and lay the chicken out, but still need to indicate which chicken breast is meant for which cooking method for the pictures. Handwriting on the paper is obviously out. And newspaper or magazine clippings could be too identifying. 

I decide to lay out eggs above each chicken breast to indicate their numbers. 1 egg for chicken breast #1, 2 eggs for chicken breast #2, etc. 

Chicken Breast #1 is air-fried

Chicken Breast #2 is baked

Chicken Breast #3 is boiled

Chicken Breast #4 is grilled

Each of the breasts is seasoned with rosemary and red-wine vinegar, fyi ;)

It also occured to me that the chicken breasts and eggs themselves could also be potentially used to narrow down the city or state I'm in, so I had to make a few minor alterations to the photo for OpSec purposes, just to be safe. 

Before Cooking pic - https://linx.li/s/chicken3cleaned.png

So far, good.

Oh man, all that preparation sure made me hungry. I don't know what I was more excited about, seeing which method took the most weight off a chicken breast, or finally getting to dig into one one!

My hypothesis was that air-frying would remove the most weight, making it the most unhealthy method, albeit still far healthier than traditional frying.

I also hypothesized that boiling might actually add weight to the chicken breast, making it the healthiest method.

Looking at the results now, it looks to me like both my asssumptions were right. Even if the boiled chicken didn't add weight, it certainly took the least off. Some of you may see it differently but I think one thing we can all agree on is the grilled piece def looks the tastiest!!

Dear Android, I was once a loyal solider in your kitkat, oreo, and gingerbread army, i have failed to recognize your beauty and simplicity. I followed the herd and moved from my Nexus to an Apple, i have grown to regret this decision. As i am still, in 2019, unable to simply copy and paste my media into an Apple, i find myself wondering about the choices i have made that led me to this despair. Oh my dear Android, i have failed you, i am now stuck with the difficulties and the consequences of my decisions. However, my dear, i promise you, i will find my way back into your Pixel heart, and i will cherish you for eternity. Yours truly, a jackass that switch to IOS
Hey hosters! I’m constantly finding myself forgetting to do things more and more. Now that we have a second child, I have more things to remember.

I’m in need of something I can self host where I can add and remove notifications that will send them to my phone (iOS) at specific times. I could use the prowler api if necessary. Does Gotify have these abilities?

Would be nice to also have ability to send to more than one device. I hate using the iPhone reminder system FYI.


Just wanted to give my feedback on upgrading from iphone6s to iphone11pro

I spend a long time studying reviews, this forum and going to actual stores and comparing models. Especially iPhone XS, 11 and 11pro. 

I was especially concerned about the loss of 3Dtouch and touchID as Well as the pwm dimmed oled screen and the reports of yellow screen tint. 

During my long visits in the stores comparing screens the yellow tint on the 11pros was obvious. 
Comparing the xs with the 11pro the pros was so yellow that with true tone it was almost as yellow in the tint as the xs with truetone on. 
The iPhone 11 actually has a really lovely screen. Very well calibrated but I couldn’t justify paying that much for a low resolution screen and I found the phone too big. So decided it was time to try the Oled screen. 
The better camera and longer battery-life compared to the XS also appealed to me.

After owning the phone for a couple of days I am very happy with it. 
Pwm turned out to be a non issue for me. 
My oled screen is very uniform. 
The loss of 3Dtouch wasn’t as bad as expected. I miss it and I definitely prefer it over haptic touch. But I will get used to the new haptic touch. 
The loss of touchID was much worse.  Man I miss it. It’s not so much the way you navigate without home button. Because this actually seem more intuitive. 
No it’s when you phone is rested on the table beside you. You have to touch it and lean to unlock. I really miss just resting my finger on the fingerprint reader. 
However I must add that I am kind of impressed of the angles the camera is able to scan your face from. 
As I wear glasses the camera wasn’t able to recognize me in the dark without glasses. So I found out it was possible to add an alternative facescan in settings. This fixed it. Rather impressive. 

The battery life coming from the 6s is needless to say impressive. 
But it still gets very very hot using for instance video calling. 

The camera is stunning. Especially night mode. 

The biggest issue turned out to be the calibration of the screen or the consequences of the chosen yellow tint by apple. I am convinced that this is a deliberate decision by apple and not a consequence of bad panels or any other faults or errors. 
I have been to numerous stores checking 11pro screens and they all have a distinct yellow tint. 

I have remedied the problem somewhat by turning off truetone and adjusting the nuance in settings/accessibility/screen and text size/colorfilters 
But unfortunately it cannot be remedied completely. You get used to the tint but when switching from iPad to iPhone the screen is definitely a bit off. A shame. 
I wish I knew apple’s reasoning behind this decision. 
iPhone has always been know for their well calibrated screens. So I wish I knew why this decision was made. 

In the end I am very happy with my purchase. It’s a great phone. But could have been greater.
I currently have a OnePlus 5, and I want to switch to an iPhone with an OLED display. I'm torn between the iPhone X and iPhone 11 Pro Max. I've laid out a couple points for each device, but I still can't decide.

# iPhone X

**+ Cheaper price**

\+ Hardware jailbreak for all future iOS versions

\+ Slower depreciation

# iPhone 11 Pro Max

**+ Massive battery**

\+ Stronger glass

\+ Faster SoC

\+ More iOS updates

\+ Ultra-wide camera

What would you do in my situation? Let me know if I'm missing anything or if you have any advice!
Hi all! I’ve been recently using mediabox HD for a long time and recently I had to uninstall it for reasons and recently I decided that I should install it again but from any download site I install it from my iPhone pops up and error and says “cannot be installed try again later” any way to fix this??

Edit: I’m also running iOS 13.1.3 for anyone wondering

Edit 2: it’s working now guys! It’s looks to have been an issue on their end!
I have a Samsung Galaxy S10+ (AT&amp;T, Pie) with 5.7.3.-3bc6f703d version of Kardia installed. When I attempt to take a screenshot, I get "Can't take screenshot because of security policy."

Our IT police tells me there are no screenshot policies enforced by our Company Portal (includes policy manager).

All other apps allow screenshots (known exceptions like incognito mode in Chrome).  AliveCor support blames it on Android, saying "You are able to screenshot with no issues on an Iphone the issue would be with the android software"  

Why would "Android" arbitrarily prohibit screenshots in Kardia app?  It has to some miss by Kardia developers.

Can anyone report screenshot success on Android?


Hello all,

I'll keep it short and sweet. Lately I've been wondering what the fucking point of it all is. I don't care about getting a better job. Oh great, more money for more dumb shit. I don't care about getting a relationship anymore. I don't care about "improving my life" whatever that means. I just want to grab a few million, buy some den in a remote location, and fuck around by myself for the rest of my life. 

Also yeah let me point out the obvious. "Wow you sound depressed bro" yeah no fucking shit. Call it depression call it being overly cynical whatever. I don't want to kill myself. I just don't want to put effort into shit I don't care about anymore. It sucks that we need to make this many dollars a month to survive in this life. Like you almost need to devote the prime years of your life to  a corporation or employer or entity to get access to your time. Can't wait for my fake retirement at age 75. Boy those are gonna be good times. No one is allowed to just say fuck it anymore. You're called a loser and a leech and selfish. You're ostracized by friends and family. You're a bum. Fuck that. There's not even enough jobs to go around. But no let's make people go back to school to get into debt for some degree they don't give a shit about for a job they don't give a shit about. Not like a robot will be doing it anyway in a few years.  

Why the fuck should I give so much of my time to a society that could give two shits about me whether I exist or not? Is that just the way things are? I guess I should be grateful I wasn't born in medieval europe as an indentured servant. Although I still am one, just with a car and an iPhone 57. 

Sorry for the dumbass rant. Lately I've just been fed up with shit and I just want to be a shut in now. Some may relate, some may think I'm being an immature cunt who needs to grow the fuck up and learn that you're entitled to nothing in life. Fair point, but it doesn't stop me from seeing how pointless this shit is.
(Sorry it was too long and I was too lazy to proofread, so just be warned: I’m French and I use an iPhone with autocorrect)


_Homescapes is a great game. Clever levels, super nice background story, and yet, something can annoy more than one player: the game’s designed to be unforgiving and even sometimes require luck, because in-app purchases. Don’t get me wrong, that’s not the topic (and is a completely different subject to discuss), but I was just pointing out that, since the game lives on purchases, it of course makes it tend towards the rapid consumption of hearts and the slow regeneration of said hearts. And I feel like players need something to stay on the game while they can’t play the main levels._

And that might as well be… a **LEVEL EDITOR**! That would be awesome. Think about it: people being able to make their own Homescapes levels, but also share them with the community, using some form of workshop!

To give details, we’d be able to have two categories of levels: • local levels, stored on your device, only for you or your friends to play and/or edit; • shared levels, which you uploaded to the workshop and let the community try them.

We’d have some form of Trending category to play the most popular levels, and their difficulty based on the success rate. Don’t forget leaderboards! And how good levels are as well, based on an upvote/downvote system. I remind you those levels could be played freely, regardless of your number of hears.


**Now, how would the actual editor work? Well, it would need to give you tons of options, to build levels, just like the official ones:**

— Choosing the size and shape of the board

— Setting the number of moves

— Choosing what is on the board by default: select slots with random colors, others with pre-defined colors to put (keeping in mind no color alignment can appear on the default state)

— Choosing which bonuses to put (planes, rockets, bombs, rainbow balls)

— Adding special items: donuts, donut machines, biscuits, jelly (and what is inside it), oil, soap, boxes, magic boxes (and what they contain!), chains, cat statues, and so on and so forth, item and bonus generators, you know them all

— The toughness of each item that supports it (the number of hits it needs to take), e.g. biscuits, boxes or jelly

— The victory conditions: select what needs to be achieved in order to complete the level (specific colors, carpets, destroying a certain amount of special items)

— The number of colors used (3, 4 or 5)

— The wind: in which direction(s) would the items fall

— If there are donuts/donut machines, falling borders would be added according to gravity (a.k.a. the above-mentioned wind)

— Choose where to put portals if we want them

— The **number of boards**: when all conditions have been cleared on one board, move to the next one

— Choose the direction to slide in to reach the next board

— Choose if the boards are connected, so if one’s items can actually end up falling to the other, or if they are separate

— Choose the _hierarchy_ in victory conditions: that means which objectives paper planes should go for in priority (and that move suggestions should prioritize as well, or if they should prioritize bonus creation)

— I probably missed a bunch

**There could also be some more creative/obscure/game changing (pick the word you like) options:**

— Turning off suggestions

— Giving a specific number of additional bonuses (hammers, gloves) for the level, and **divide the players in two categories**: those who used them as the ones who didn’t

— Allow _diagonal moves_ or not (I know, it’s now how the game works, but it could be a fun addition to build a specific puzzle design around), for special levels

— Change bonus item hierarchy: by default it’s Rainbow Ball &gt; Bomb &gt; Rocket &gt; Paper Plane. But maybe we’d like to change that to perhaps limit rainbow balls. Or even change it so that **both** items are created when two specific structures are made in one move (like when a rocket is formed by a structure that would have formed a plane if it hadn’t had the long part that made it become a rocket)



This is getting technical, but you get the point: **allowing everything we could come up with** to really customize levels, and share them with our teams, friends, or the world. Now come the 4 biggest issues with the idea and how to tackle them.


***Wouldn’t people stop playing regular levels?*** No, they wouldn’t. Because fan-made levels would be creator oriented and wouldn’t give you any form of star points nor let you make progress in competitions.


***Making such a platform would be expensive to develop (especially in hosting the levels), and we love when there are things for players to buy.*** I am proposing a few ideas to allow for further _CREATOR_ options, while keeping the core service free to everyone. These extra options would be **paid**, though only needed to create with them—not play levels that contain them. To get them, we could of course make it cost real money, but I think it should just cost IN-GAME GOLD COINS, so that hardcore players and eventually play-to-win those options. Here are a few examples:

— Maybe making 1-board and 2-board levels would be free, but would require an option to make 3-board levels, and also make 2-board levels with connected boards.

— Storing 15 levels locally and uploading 5 would be free, but paying would give you 30 local slots and 15 online slots—a second purchase could even push it to 50 local levels and 20-25 online ones

— Uploading one level only every 24 hours would be a restriction we could remove by paying

— Sharing a level within one’s team could cost a small amount, like maybe 500 coins

— More customization options for the editor: I think all items should be all available (just unlock at as you discover them in main levels), but maybe they could have further options to them (like how many donuts a donut machine has to make, and how many hits it takes to complete one, would be additional options for donut machines), but stuff like bonuses in violet boxes should be free (maybe other items in purple boxes could be paid: like chains popping out as a trap)

— Randomization options for certain parts of the editor


***How do we even give people an incentive to get involved in community levels?*** I think people will play them if there’s a reward. The harder a level is rated (maybe after 20 plays we give it a difficulty ranking based on its success rate and on how many moves were left at the end, on average), the more coins it could give out. Setting a new record on a level could even be a way to maybe earn a heart. _AS A CREATOR,_ getting a well-rated level with a lot of plays would also get you rewards. Participating in new level discovery (specific tab) and being one of the 20 first plays would give you a small reward for that.


FINAL ISSUE: ***Is there no risk of abuse, with that rewards system?*** Well, we’d need limitations: for instance, participating in new level discovery would only get you coins once per creator, and would realize after 24 hours. People would also be tempted to farm East levels that got rated difficult: well, we would only give rewards for beating it once, but also for breaking a record, but only if it wasn’t set by yourself or someone you already beat once.

I’m interested in your thoughts! Thanks for reading this paragraph, but I hope this suggestion could at least inspire someone in making the game better. See you down below!


Is there a “continue watching” category anywhere on the mobile app?  I can’t seem to find the list of what I’ve recently been watching any where? How do you just jump right back in to what you were previously watching?
iPhone X user here. I was managing my gmail accounts and right before my eyes it switched. I added an account FWIW. 

Today was a good day.
Hey all, just got disney plus and cant seem to get rid of those pesky subtitles on roku or iphone. Where are those settings? Thanks!
I keep getting a "You missed a message, Push notifications are turned off" in my Waze inbox, how can I fix this?

It recommends going into settings and making sure allow notifications is on. I've done this and everything is on, though I still get that message in my inbox occasionally. I know notifications work fine from Waze since I get the traffic alerts from Waze just fine.

I'm on the latest version of Waze, and iOS on an iPhone X. I seem to get the you missed a notification message at least once every few weeks.

Is there anyway to view what the message was? Also anyone have ideas on how to fix it?
Service in Vegas is all over the map. Almost no service on the runway at McCarran, then ZERO workable data at the T1 rideshare pickup spot!

Now I am at the MGM Park on a high floor and have two bars, getting 14 mbps but it will randomly drop to one bar and almost no data. 

Is there any provider in Vegas that is more consistent? Or do they all struggle with the variety of buildings and density of devices?

iPhone 11 Pro Max, over 25 GB

So, quick story time. In July 2018, I got rid of my iPhone 5s, and got a Nexus 6P instead. I did this for many reasons: budget, features, size, etc. I had a pretty good experience with it, but in the last couple months of ownership, the battery just went to shit. I even replaced the battery, and the battery life still didn't get any better. So I decided to sell that and get a Google Pixel 2 XL. And man, this phone is absolutely great. It has everything I want: a big screen (18:9), a fingerprint scanner, front facing stereo speakers, an OLED screen, ambient display, Android, USB-C, a really good camera, etc. In the past few months, the battery life has been absolute shit. And like, ABSOLUTE shit. According to my settings, a full charge lasts 6.5 hours, and my average screen time is about 2-3 hours. I've tried to uninstall many apps, and change battery saver settings, and even run it in battery saver mode, and it does nothing. I think it's also a good time to sell this one and get a new one because this one is losing value at a somewhat quick rate, at least from what I've seen.

If anyone has any phone suggestions with the following features, please let me know! Any help is appreciated.

REQUIRED:
- OLED screen (or P-LED, AMOLED, anything of the sort)
- A big screen with 18:9 ratio, must be 6.0 inches or bigger.
- Front facing stereo speakers.
- Ambient display.
- A really good camera.
- Fingerprint scanner
- USB-C port.
- Long battery life.
- AT LEAST 4GB of RAM.
- AT LEAST 64GB of storage.
- Water resistance rating of AT LEAST IP67.

DESIRED, BUT NOT REQUIRED:
- Wireless charging
- Uninterrupted screen design, but if a phone with a notch meets all of the other requirements, so be it, I'll deal with it.
I had ispoofer (free since I've already used my 3 on paid acct) on my phone, wanted to try ipogo as I was tired of the restrictions free ispoofer has. Yes, I'm spoiled by the paid ispoofer.  :)

So when I went &amp; installed ipogo it seems to have overwritten/corrupted my ispoofer.

So I take it they cant coexist on the same iphone or did I mess something up. No my phone is not j/b'ed nor am I going to. Sorry.
I am in US and got the game. It told me to install an update so I did. It was pretty fast but then it just crashed. I reopened it and it just crashed. I reinstalled it and the same thing happened. I am on iPhone 7 does anyone know how to fix this?
I'm still dealing with this right this moment so this wall of text may jump all around, I may try and edit this later.

Me and my wife live on the third floor of an apartment. There are two units on each floor. Small shitty apartments in North Jersey. There are 3 floors and 1 basement unit. There are two front doors to the building, an unsecured one, than our mailboxes in a small hallway, than a self closing/locking door.

**1st Robbery**

Came home to my door being slightly opened. Immediately noticed something was wrong. It was very obvious that someone kicked my door in. They stole some cash that was sitting on the coffee table right in front of where the front door opens. I call my landlord to tell her, And she immediately starts blaming us with lines like , " I've owned the building for 25 years and have never had an issue, IT HAS to be someone you guys know", My biggest mistake here was not filling a police report. I was/am naive. All in all he stole about 100 dollars. Didn't touch the 55 inch TV right there.

After the first robbery i told my landlord i was going to get a security camera for my front door and i took that out of rent. I was doing the right thing and got the cheapest one without a subscription. This comes to bite me in the ass for the second robbery.

**2nd Robbery**

This time the thief doesn't kick my door in, instead he just takes the electric razor scooter that is right near my front door. My camera 100% recorded him but me and the wife didn't notice till 8 days later. my security camera over writes files that are 7+ days old. Fuck me right. No footage of this robbery.

**3rd Robbery (11/11/2019)**

Came home at my usual time, to notice that the bait( and item i put on our landing to entice a thief[an empty iPhone case]) I had set was gone. Since the second robbery ive been checking the cameras daily and BOOM, we got him on camera.

I call the cops, give them the file, Tell my land lord about this THIRD robbery. She feeds me the same line of " I've owned the building for 25 years and haven't had anyone robbed, don't know why they're choosing you" I tell her, Listen, it doesn't fucking matter what you say or how many years you've been trouble free, IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACTS. the fact is, under her land lording, we have been robbed and violated 3 times. She has done nothing. She says shes shes sending her husband tomorrow to change the locks in the front door.

I have notified her via text messages multiple times that the front door isn't locking itself 100% of the time. That alls it takes is one lucky time for a thief to get back in the building. She still has yet to replace the mechanism that auto shuts the door.

The first time we were robbed she said via a text message that she would change the front door locks and install security cameras. She never did either of those things. It took us 3 times of getting robber for her to admit that she needs to change the front door locks.

PLEASE HELP ME. PLEASE TELL ME THERE IS SOMETHING I CAN LEGALLY DO AGAINST HER. This has been the biggest nightmare of my life. I have never felt so unsafe and violated in my own home. My wife is terrfied to be home alone and i don't blame her.
 I was wondering if anyone had any good HUD for the above phones. I have a 6s plus which I play on. Feel free to share any other phone hud which you think would be good. Images will be best.

\- it would be best if it works for small hands like mine and is primarily comfortable

\- really hope the HUD is good for winning cause I still need a solo win

(thanks a lot)
Trying to set up a new Oculus Quest.  I've been trying to connect it to our school's wifi network, which requires MAC Address registration.  I finally figured out how to find the MAC address and registered it, but when I try to use the iPhone Oculus app to add the Quest to wifi, it keeps giving me the incredibly unhelpful, "Something went wrong" error with no additional info. (I know i have the wifi password correct b/c getting it wrong gives an entirely different error).  

When I looked into my headset it tells me that it's "Updating Your Headset. You will be notified on your phone when your headset is ready."  I'm guessing that's why I can't connect to the wifi--b/c it's in the middle of a firmware update.  (It would have been nice if the freaking phone app would also let me know it's trying to update my headset, btw.)

On a similar post on this subreddit, it was suggested that I need to watch the safety video in order for it to complete the headset update.  But I don't see anywhere in the app to watch a safety video.  I'm guessing that it shows up after you connect to wifi, but as I said, it doesn't appear to be letting me connect to wifi until after it's finished updating.  

Help?
I have Catalina running correctly on VMware following the recommended guides. I have never had an icloud account before. I've created the account, logged into icloud/itunes/store successfully. I also just bought a new iPhone yesterday so I now have a real serial # for support and that too is showing up on my icloud account, in addition to the hackintosh macbook pro. Everytime I try and log into either iMessages or Facetime, I get the same customer code.  

Ok, no big deal, I've read enough  posts to realize calling in isn't a big deal. Tried 3 times, all 3 have failed. The first time was a phone call, and after giving them the customer code and them telling me to exit imessage and try again, and getting the same error, they wanted to do a screenshare. Ended the call.  

Later, tried the same thing with a chat. Same attempt, and eventually they wanted to screenshare. Ended the chat. 

For the third time, on a phone call, I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor (per other posts) and felt confident this person would know what they were doing unlike the lower people. He asked for my serial, and I gave him the Clover serial (real, but unregistered, per the 2 websites). He then tried a few more things that involved more reboots, and sending me to a website authentication page, but still got errors. In the end, he did NOT ask to screen share, and said "everything is green" on his screen, so it appeared to be a server/issue on their end, and said he needed to forward my info along to the engineering team to see if they could get me activated, and that he'd reach back out to me with results. 

It's been like 6 hours since then, with no updates. 6+ hours and counting is much different than the several data points I've read on here of successful 20 minute phone calls. But is it possible that the engineering team is currently behind the scenes and will ultimately get me whitelisted?  Just wait it out?

Or am I still taking the wrong approach and need to talk to a supervisor a 4th time? How else can I guide or point the supervisor in the right direction without raising any alarms of the supervisor?
I’m considering switching to Sprint in the Northern Virginia area with the unlimited kickstart plan. I have a few questions. 

They’ve shown me the clean slate program to cover the remainder on two iPhone XR’s but I’ve seen some people say it didn’t work like they expected it to- does anyone have experience with how it worked/how much they got back?

I’m also trying to verify that calls can be made while using data on newer iPhones. My husband runs a business and is often on job sites where he needs to access information while on a call. Can anyone verify that?

Signal wise we’ve been able to comfortably establish that we will have signal where we need it since my sister has Sprint currently. 

If this works out I can cut my phone bill in half from AT&amp;T while simultaneously getting an even newer phone so I’m pretty stoked about this possibility.
For the past couple of weeks, every single time I open bear, open a note and try to type something, it crashes. Every single time. It crashes even if do not type anything as well. It just takes longer to crash in that situation.

Does this happen to anyone else? I see some recent negative reviews on App Store claiming this as well.


As title says, my fast charger is not working with Checkra1n JB. When I restart without jb, it’s working fine. After boot with Checkra1n jb, fast Charing is not working. Just 1 bling and vibration. (So restart again, it’s working fine)

Tried to remove and re-install Cydia already but no result. Anybody else same problem? iPhone X IOS 13.2.2 and Checkra1n 0.9.2.
Hi all,

My jailbroken 13.2.2 iPhone 8 Plus worked last night and probably died before I woke up this morning. When I tried to re-jailbreak it, I found out I can't open Cydia anymore. I did a few more tries and occasionally Wi-Fi and taptic feedback doesn't work. Sometimes it stuck after the checkra1n boot logo. Tried to enter the safe mode by pressing volume + immediately after seeing the first Apple logo. Not sure if it worked since there's really no signs of it being "activated".

Please, if anyone could shed a light, would be much appreciated!
When I asked Siri to calculate a sum in US dollars, she rounded to the nearest thousand and gave me a table of currency conversions. When I asked for the same sum without mentioning dollars, she provided the correct response with the correct precision. (See [here](https://imgur.com/a/C18S24O).)

iPhone X on 13.2.2 here. This morning, my JB was half working, so I decided to re-jailbreak using the most recent version of checkra1n (0.9.2). Everything went smoothly, but when it booted back up, Face ID wasn't working (Unable to activate Face ID on this device) . I went to reset it in Settings, but it was not possible. Restored using the tool in the checkra1n app, and Face ID was working again. Any ideas as to why it is preventing me from using it?
Mint iPhone 8 Verizon unlocked used for about a year. Been on a case since day one the only flaw seems to be one tiny pixel noticeable on white bright screens; Very hard to notice. Battery health at 90%. Comes with a clear case no original box.

Price is firm, I would appreciate if messages with interest about the phone don’t include negotiations. Saves everyone time and effort.

I have always been able to send and receive group texts but in the last few days I have noticed that I am not receiving group texts immediately. Sometimes it is hours or even a full day later when I finally receive them. And then they all come at once in a burst.

No problems sending or receiving individual texts though. I tried resetting network settings, soft rebooting phone, toggling airplane mode. Hasn’t seemed to fix the problem.

Anyone else experiencing the problem? Got a solution?
Hey everyone, I lost my iPhone 6 in Bahen on the second floor (i think) yesterday. If you find it by any chance, I would appreciate if you can dm me or give it to the lost and found guys in Bahen! I am down to buy you coffee lol, I am broke AF so coffee is all I can afford! Thanks everyone.  :)
My power button is broken and I can’t enter dfu mode because of that. Assistive touch power button doesn’t work, and all software I could find to enter dfu manually is very outdated and not working. Any ideas?
I’m an aspiring film maker and a friend and I decided to make a few short films together. I have my shirt film all thought out and am going to start writing the script soon. While we both are really passionate about this we don’t have a lot of good equipment. Out best option right now is to shoot the film on our IPhone Xrs’. How would the quality of the film turn out? Should we splurge and get a slightly better camera. If not then are there any tips for shooting good video on an IPhone. Also We already bought lavaliere mics and a cheap camera stabilizer.

Anyone that has iKeywi 4 on iOS 13, is it working for you? Are you having any issues?

Once I install it after respring, I get an endless respring until reboot, others are reporting it's working without issues.

I'm on iPhone X 13.2.2
Hi. I recently replaced by iPhone 6 with a new iPhone 11 which is running iOS 13. I still have a lot to learn but one of the first things I’ve noticed is that on safari, if I have several tabs open and then close safari and reopen it, all the tabs are gone. On my old phone, if I had tabs open and then closed safari by double tapping the home button and swiping up, and then reopened it again the tabs would still be there. Is this something I can do on my new phone? Thanks for reading.
Let's just say amphetamine is one hell of a drug. Here goes my story:

Acetone washing is a harm reduction technique applicable to many substances including meth, amphetamine, cocaine, and more. 

In addition to purifying the drugs you plan to consume, acetone washing is also helpful in evaluating the overall quaity of a product as a whole. This is done by weighing the drugs before acetone washing, and then again after the wash is complete, to see how much weight in impurities were lost in the process. 

Alas, even an acetone wash is not necessarily a litmus test for evaluating drug quality/purity since impurities can also be added to your amphetamine or meth, for instance, that aren't soluble in acetone, and therefore will not be removed by an acetone wash.

Impurities in chicken breasts, on the other hand, are not of nearly as much concern as black market narcotics; unless you happen to be one of those anti GMO/Hormone/Caged/Waterboarding faggots. Like it's my fault waterboarding a chicken for 40 seconds before it's beheaded relelases hormones in the body that make it taste better. Fuck you.

As some of you may know; air-frying is all the rage right now. And since Sunday is meal-prep day anyway, I've decided to apply our acetone-wash-weight-test to different methods of cooking skinless chicken breasts. I'm going to weigh 4 chicken breasts, then cook them all to precisely 165 degrees farenheit using different methods and see which one removes the most weight from a skinless chicken breast.

The 4 methods of cooking will be air-fried, oven-baked, grilled, and boiled. 

Unfortunately, the only scale I have has a maximum weight capacity of like 30 grams, so actually weighing each chicken breast is out of the question. This means we'll have to eyeball it. I'll take before and after pictures of the chicken breasts that you can evaluate yourselves later on.

Now, the first concern of any Drug Enthusiast is OpSec, so I need to photograph and label these chicken breasts in a way that can't be traced back to me. This goes much, much further than snapping a shot and wiping the metadata. Intelligence Agencies can gleen a plethora of information from even the most insignificant details in a photo. The style of table, the type of wood on a floor, the paint color on the walls. All these things can be used to narrow down an agent's list of suspects who could possibly be you. 

Even imperfections in a few of the millions of pixels modern cameras capture can be uniquely attributed to your device retroactively.

This means, ideally, I would acquire a device capable of taking pictures annonymously for one-time use. The iphone I snagged from some alcoholic's back pocket at a bar a little while back, for instance; which I will use for the photos in this experiment, and then destroy beyond recognition. Bars are a great place to steal phones because drunks lose them at bars all the time anyway and will be much less suspicious that it was stolen in that scenario, especially if they are hammered.

I need to cover the table with something also but what? At first I thought looseleaf paper should be ok but then remembered an article I read about how all printer paper bears marks imperceptible to the eye that can indicate when it was made and where it was sent. If printer paper bears such marks, it stands to reason that looseleaf these days may as well. 

I have some old cardboard ringbinder folders that I could lay out, but they are so old, I wonder how many people could possibly have these particular ring-binder folders in such mint condition. I could burn them after I'm done, but they really don't make em' like this anymore...

Paper Towels, I wonder. But what if the designs on rolls of paper towels, like the imperceptible markings of printer paper, also bear tiny imperfections that can be correlated back to where/when that particular roll of paper towels was manufactured and shipped to? Too risky. 

In fact, it seems there's nothing in my home that I could take a picture of this chicken on top of that couldn't be potentially traced back to me. 

I decide to go out and make a cash purchase of some graph paper. Graph paper will also make it easier to eyeball each chicken breast after it's cooked anyway, so win-win. First, I walk into town and find a homeless person. I tell him I'll pay him ten bucks to drive the next town or so over with me and buy me some graph paper. He agrees. We walk to my car, which I've parked about a 1/2 mile from my place, and head out. Needless to say, my cellphone is left at home duct taped to my cat.

The homeless guy and I get 50 or so miles out to the edge of some town, then stop in a secluded spot and pull the bicycles out of my trunk, we ride the bikes into town and find a General Store. We ride about a mile away from the general store, and then I have the homeless guy walk back to get the graph paper. He returns. There's trouble. He bought sandpaper. 

Turns out this homeless person, nor the next one, even know what graph paper is. Third times a charm: Homeless Mitch pulls through, regaling me with opprobrious tales of a derelict nature along the way. He says he used to own clydesdales and insists the American vagabond is dead. 

I don't realise I'm out of cash and there can't be more than $1.50 left in Homeless Mitch's pocket until he's already brought me the graph paper, so I drive us back, put a glock in his face and tell him to get the fuck out of my car. Sorry Homeless Mitch, nothing personal. Your vagrant peers are to blame.

Finally I get back with the graph paper and lay the chicken out, but still need to indicate which chicken breast is meant for which cooking method for the pictures. Handwriting on the paper is obviously out. And newspaper or magazine clippings could be too identifying. 

I decide to lay out eggs above each chicken breast to indicate their numbers. 1 egg for chicken breast #1, 2 eggs for chicken breast #2, etc. 

Chicken Breast #1 is air-fried

Chicken Breast #2 is baked

Chicken Breast #3 is boiled

Chicken Breast #4 is grilled

Each of the breasts is seasoned with rosemary and red-wine vinegar, fyi ;)

It also occured to me that the chicken breasts and eggs themselves could also be potentially used to narrow down the city or state I'm in, so I had to make a few minor alterations to the photo for OpSec purposes, just to be safe. 

Before Cooking pic - https://linx.li/s/chicken3cleaned.png

So far, good.

Oh man, all that preparation sure made me hungry. I don't know what I was more excited about, seeing which method took the most weight off a chicken breast, or finally getting to dig into one one!

My hypothesis was that air-frying would remove the most weight, making it the most unhealthy method, albeit still far healthier than traditional frying.

I also hypothesized that boiling might actually add weight to the chicken breast, making it the healthiest method.

Looking at the results now, it looks to me like both my asssumptions were right. Even if the boiled chicken didn't add weight, it certainly took the least off. Some of you may see it differently but I think one thing we can all agree on is the grilled piece def looks the tastiest!!
Hopefully I don’t sound like an idiot but I have an iPhone 7 and have for years and I just got an 11 and was wondering how to take a screenshot without the button thanks

Hi folks! Does anybody got a functional stream on AppleTV? ExpressVPN DNS doesn’t seems to work! Heard NordVPN should be better? Any suggestion? ExpressVPN works on iPhone and Mac. But not on AppleTV 😑

Has anyone tried using the iPhone av hdmi adapter to stream the iOS app on there TV. I am without WiFi right now and was thinking about picking one up but I was curious of how it worked first
I'm mostly having issues taking photos on pretty much every camera-based app on my phone...

Can someone please share the directions on how to login to my Walmart workplace account on iphone?
Hello everyone, just wanted to post here and see if anyone has had an experience like mine and could maybe help.

I recently added my wife to my phone plan off of her parent's plan right before we got married. She also bought a new iPhone 11. The store rep didn't activate it there and we've had trouble ever since with account issues. I tried to activate it myself and was told by support to just "turn it off and back on again," which did nothing. We were finally able to get her service so she could text and call by providing the Device ID and IMEI to a support person. I thought we were all good then...

Fast forward to now, and I'm trying to add her Apple Music that she's eligible for because we have unlimited plans. I've already enrolled my device successfully in the past, so I went to add-ons to add hers. It shows that it's an iPhone 11, but then says that her device is not eligible for Apple Music. The only thing I can think of is that if I look at her device under the "Manage devices" tab, it doesn't show anything under the device model. So I'm thinking that the system doesn't realize that it's actually an iPhone (and a support representative I talked to today said that that could be an issue why it won't let me add Apple Music to her phone).

He gave me the same advice that we got when we were trying to activate the phone: turn it off and back on again to reactivate the device and maybe it will load the phone model information. Is this really the way to activate phones on the Verizon network? I'm worried it's not going to work now since it didn't work then. Is there any other way to load the device model into Verizon's system? Is there anything else that could be blocking enrollment of the phone into Apple Music?

Thanks in advance for your responses.


Hey everyone! So my cohost and I live in different states and have been trying to use the app Zoom instead of Skype because the sound quality is way better in our opinion. Only issue though is that is that with the basic plan through Zoom you can’t record your meetings. So I’ve attempted to record the iPhone screen and followed all the steps properly that I’ve seen online but with no luck. If it asks to save to my camera roll there’s no audio from the zoom meeting and if I choose to save the recording to zoom it gives me an error message or records but I have no idea where it saves the audio file to. I also use this with my headset mic plugged into my iPhone. Has anyone else had this same issue when trying to record your screen? I’m at a loss here. Thanks in advance!

If it wasn’t for iMessage, Samsung’s would be the majority of phones sold imo. I own an iPhone :/ and had to pay $600 to get the internals repaired after dropping it once with a case on it. If you have an older version of the iPhone and upgrade to the current OS, your phone slows down. Someone object my statements please.

In fact, it seems there's nothing in my home that I could take a picture of this chicken on top of that couldn't be potentially traced back to me. 

I decide to go out and make a cash purchase of some graph paper. Graph paper will also make it easier to eyeball each chicken breast after it's cooked anyway, so win-win. First, I walk into town and find a homeless person. I tell him I'll pay him ten bucks to drive the next town or so over with me and buy me some graph paper. He agrees. We walk to my car, which I've parked about a 1/2 mile from my place, and head out. Needless to say, my cellphone is left at home duct taped to my cat.

The homeless guy and I get 50 or so miles out to the edge of some town, then stop in a secluded spot and pull the bicycles out of my trunk, we ride the bikes into town and find a General Store. We ride about a mile away from the general store, and then I have the homeless guy walk back to get the graph paper. He returns. There's trouble. He bought sandpaper. 

Turns out this homeless person, nor the next one, even know what graph paper is. Third times a charm: Homeless Mitch pulls through, regaling me with opprobrious tales of a derelict nature along the way. He says he used to own clydesdales and insists the American vagabond is dead. 

I don't realise I'm out of cash and there can't be more than $1.50 left in Homeless Mitch's pocket until he's already brought me the graph paper, so I drive us back, put a glock in his face and tell him to get the fuck out of my car. Sorry Homeless Mitch, nothing personal. Your vagrant peers are to blame.

Finally I get back with the graph paper and lay the chicken out, but still need to indicate which chicken breast is meant for which cooking method for the pictures. Handwriting on the paper is obviously out. And newspaper or magazine clippings could be too identifying. 

I decide to lay out eggs above each chicken breast to indicate their numbers. 1 egg for chicken breast #1, 2 eggs for chicken breast #2, etc. 

Chicken Breast #1 is air-fried

Chicken Breast #2 is baked

Chicken Breast #3 is boiled

Chicken Breast #4 is grilled

Each of the breasts is seasoned with rosemary and red-wine vinegar, fyi ;)

It also occured to me that the chicken breasts and eggs themselves could also be potentially used to narrow down the city or state I'm in, so I had to make a few minor alterations to the photo for OpSec purposes, just to be safe.

So far, good.

Oh man, all that preparation sure made me hungry. I don't know what I was more excited about, seeing which method took the most weight off a chicken breast, or finally getting to dig into one one!

My hypothesis was that air-frying would remove the most weight, making it the most unhealthy method, albeit still far healthier than traditional frying.

I also hypothesized that boiling might actually add weight to the chicken breast, making it the healthiest method.

Looking at the results now, it looks to me like both my asssumptions were right. Even if the boiled chicken didn't add weight, it certainly took the least off. Some of you may see it differently but I think one thing we can all agree on is the grilled piece def looks the tastiest!!

I have had my g5 for a long time and I just recently got a message that the app needed to be deleted and reinstalled, I have never had this error and got a little worried, but I was at school and just checked and decided to deal with it when I got home. So I check the app and it still isn’t working and I checked my followers and it said that I had no followers and said that I needed to invite them. So confused I deleted the app and tried to redownload it. When I hit the little cloud button it just tries to download it but it doesn’t bring up the progress and doesn’t show anywhere in my home. I have an iPhone 8 and I am going to update my phone to see if that’s the issue if anybody knows anything please comment
Edit: I fixed it we’re good now
Anyone have any experience with anything like this?
Hi, my iPhone 8 got stolen recently and I was thinking of buying a Pixel 3a since I really appreciate camera quality.  
How good is the front camera, compared to the Pixel 3 for example?  
I know the 3a has one camera instead of two, but is it as high-quality as the 3? I'm asking this because many reviewers only talk about the rear camera

Thanks
I first posted this on r/nosurf and was told people here would appreciate it as well.

First I have to mention that this method only works on the iPhone at least for now.

So I was looking for a method to stop looking at my phone so much throughout the day, and I realized the iPhone already had exactly what I needed, which is setting daily time limits on the apps I wanted. This is done in ScreenTime which is found in Settings. The problem is it just gives you a notification that you have reached the time limit.

The solution to this is to set a passcode, now when you reach the time limit you will get asked the passcode. But obviously if you know the passcode you can ignore the time limit just as easily.

So as a developer I got my hands to work and created a simple web app tool(100% free). This tool generates passcodes for you to use in ScreenTime, once you set your passcode you go back to the tool and theres a little memory game that is designed to make you forget the passcode you just used. The web app wont show you the passcode again until 20 hours later (feature to show the passcode until specific date coming soon).

Now I just feel free, with a lot more time to enjoy and do productive things. I realized the phone was taking way too much time. I also believe that the dopamine generated from social networks and messages in the phone make real life look a bit boring. So I take phone addiction as something serious, thats why this tool is free for all to use.

The web app: https://passcode-generator.herokuapp.com

A small tutorial: https://youtu.be/winhwnpOUpk

I hope this tool helps you as much as it did to me. It really changes your life and perspective when you stop using your phone almost entirely!
Any tips or things i should look out for?
I have a ton of cases and I'm bored with all of them so I decided to use my 8 plus without a case for a while to see how I like it. The temperature is dropping significantly so I was wondering if the phone is hard to grip/more slippery in the winter time. 

What do you think and what phone do you use?
I have Xfinity Mobile (runs on Verizon’s cell towers) for my Apple Watch. Every morning, i go for a run with only my AW, leave the iPhone behind, and as soon as i exit out WiFi the AW cellular gets untoggled automatically and it says i am disconnected.  I have to toggled it back on, it happens every time. Called Apple support and they advised to unpair the AW and reset - that didn’t work. I need help fixing this, going to comcast customer service is the worse. Has anyone had a similar experience? Any solutions? Running on latest WatchOS 6.1.

A chunk of the storage in the little graph in settings is under OTHER and it is a darkish gray unlike Apps, Media, Photos, Ect

I also notice another, lighter gray that is unspecified storage that has been taken up

Virus?
So, i Have an iPhone 6s plus iOS 12.3.1  


I just downloaded checkra1n beta 0.92 jailbreak update and everything ran smooth and fine.  
I was able to download Cydia and it, itself, works as supposed to.   


Whenever I download an app tho the icon will show up but when I click it the app will open and close in less than a second.  
I also can't seem to uninstall the apps after installing them. Even if uninstalled in Cyndia the icons remain for some reason.  


I know its only been a few days since iOS 12.3.1 is jailbreakable, could this be an update problem with Cyndia or the apps?  


I've been googling this for the last two hours but none of the solutions i find seem to help and most involve Cyndia apps that arent downloadable or buyable in my iOS version :+(  


Is there a way to fix this?

I’m having a weird problem - 13.2.2 iphone 8 checkra1n 9.2 - when I install apps through Cydia (NewTerm2, for example), they don’t show up on Springboard. Any suggestions on why and what I might try to fix this issue? Thanks.
So here's the deal.

i switched to rogers from my old provider because i got a 20% discount at the time. had to constantly call in to have the discount added back because each month it'd be "magically accidentally removed". I no longer work for the company that was giving me that discount so i no longer have it. i knew my bill would go up, but not this much.

Me and my sister are on the same plan. we have 2 pohones and 2 tablets. none of these are paid off :

&amp;#x200B;

x1 Samsung S10, on it's current plan costing, 140.00

x1 Iphone X on it's current plan costing 85.00

x1 Samsung Tab-A costing 22.50

x1 Ipad Costing 30.00

I figured everything with tax would be coming out to about \~300.00 or so, which is still really high as all hell. i understand that these device are not paid off , but the prices above are supposed to include the device cost as well. when i was on the discount it was around \~240 for all 4 devices which is not too terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

however, the bill keeps coming in as above \~400.00 this month it was \~410.00, before it was 480.00! there were some occasional text to family in the states and a single call that cost $8.00 that my sister made. but that's it. Rogers cannot tell me why the bill is as high as it is and will only say it's accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

they said to  switch us on to the unlimited plans to "save us money" but the plans cost the same amount as my old plans so there is no savings what so ever. I'm on 20, becasue i use my device alot at school and on the transit there. my sister is on the 10 gb.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes it even worse is that where i go to school (College) there is absolutely no rogers cell signal, and i'm there 50% of the day monday-friday. 10% of the time i get Emergency calls only, the rest it says No Service. "We don't have a tower in your area.", they say, so they tell me to use the school's wifi to do everything, which i cannot use because the transmission and security protocols the schools network uses do not work on my android device. so i'm paying for services that i can't even use more than half the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel trapped. i'm a college student and i can't just pay off these devices, yet i can't even use them. there's over 2000+ owing total on all 4 devices, although only 800 or so is mine, i still cannot just go pay them off. 

&amp;#x200B;

how can i go about lowering my bill? i hate to say this but i'll be leaving rogers if it cannot be lowered. yes i owe money still, buton an unrelated note, my mother fucked up my credit (which is for another story) so i already have bad credit. adding this to it would make much difference. eventually i would pay it off of course.

&amp;#x200B;

any ideas guys? thanks.
So I decided to get a used Apple Watch s3 from eBay next April. (My birthday.) I have a couple of questions that I would love to be answered.
 1. Can you use the radio function offline? Or does it have to be connected to wifi? 
2. Everyone says that the display on s4 is way better. Is that true? 
3. Is the vibrations and notification too loud that it would disturb me in class?
 4. If I didn’t use the workouts that much, would I get about 2 days of wearing? 
5. The new “Screen Time” thing on iPhone and iPads, does it connect to the Apple Watch if it is on your iCloud account? And if so, what apps are declined automatically? 
Thank you!
Hi guys, using method 1 and phone number works great. Downside is only to some people will my message send otherwise it just gives the error exclamation point. Any ideas? Using S9+, ATT, Mac mini server and iPhone 6 with inactive SIM.
I bought the IFIXIT Pro Tech Toolkit so I could replace the screen and battery on my iPhone 6s, and I noticed it came with an anti-static wrist band. I hadn't considered static for this repair before seeing the band, but now I'm curious. 

Should I wear this wrist band and ground it to carry out the screen and battery replacement ? Should I be doing this procedure on an anti-static mat? Or are these only precautions I'd need to take when working with more sensitive components?

Any advice you've got is appreciated!
Hi all,

I was just on a conference call with some BIG potential clients. Like LIFECHANGINGLY big. I was on my bluetooth headset but suddenly the call went dead. I soon realized it's because my wife started the car in the driveway AND THE CALL TRANSFERRED TO HER IN THE CAR.

It looked incredibly unprofessional and I wasn't able to get back into the conference call. Thankfully I seem to have salvaged the situation. But I need to make sure this never happens again. 

How can I make sure that my call stays on the bluetooth device that I'm using and never transfers to another one?

Hey guys,

I'm really interested in getting the iPhone xr. I'm coming from Android (Google pixel 3xl) with an OLED display. 

Is the display really not that good? I use dark mode for the most part. I know the xr has stellar battery life. 

Let me know your opinions!

Thanks.
I literally cannot play for longer than 20 seconds without it crashing. Worthless.

And I have done everything suggested by the helpdesk, including deleting and re-downloading the app. Nothing works.


How do I fix this? I'm not particular at this point on the JB method, just want my tweaks back.
I’m just using the basic iPhone app right now. Does anybody know of a good app with similar features to podcast addict like “skip silence” or listening time?

I'm wondering if I should be using a VPN while streaming things that I have downloaded. Will the ISP I'm using on my iPhone not like that I am streaming a downloaded file? Will the ISP where my NAS is not like that I am streaming a downloaded file? I can use VPN but then it disables my port forwarding rules which makes video station slow.

I have a DS918+ btw. If it makes it any easier, I also have a Synology RT2600AC as my router.

Heyo, got a spare phone to get rid of. iPhone 6 sporting 16GB storage, Silver, and on 11.4.1. can be jailbroken with unc0ver or Electra. Tiny scuff on top left and bottom right corners, screen is doing fine. It's at 88% battery health and everything works, including Touch ID. I'd say the phone is around Good condition. Would be mind if it didn't have the scuffs.

I'm looking for possibly $83 shipped. I know, weird number.

Hello all,

This morning, I updated checkra1n 0.9.1 iPhone X running iOS 13.2.2 to checkra1n 0.9.2. When booting, the screen did not initially work. Not responsive, but the buttons worked. I went back into DFU mode, and rejailbroke. After booting up, I received a prompt saying FaceID could not be activated. I went into Settings &gt; FaceID and I Reset FaceID. I went back into DFU mode and rejailbroke in which FaceID worked again. Due to the instability of this beta, it froze and automatically restarted. I now am debating on going back to 0.9.1 or 0.9. I have seen many people go back to 0.9.

Best of luck to anyone running the new version of checkra1n

Can we burn it?

I’ve had my Apple Watch for a week now and I’m struggling to find the crown scroll settings. Or any scroll settings for the Apple Watch tbh. Anyone know where on the Apple Watch or iPhone I can find this setting.  Also if it means anything, the Apple Watch is on my right wrist with the crown on the upper right of the watch.

Hi, I have a iPhone 8+ and I've noticed lately that my notifications are coming a couple minutes late. I've noticed it recently but most recent when I get messages and they pop up and say "4m ago" and it's slightly inconvenient because some are time sensitive. Do you have an idea or solution to this problem? It seems to happen regardless of location or whether I'm on wifi or not.
My device is 10.1.1 iPhone 6S and I'm trying to but my jailbreak back onto my phone. Impactor is down so I'm using XCode. I go to devices select the IPA and it attempts to run but nothing happens. So I just did a random test run clicked play on XCode and it ran into so many issues signing because the recent xCode is all for 13.3 Are there any other methods to sideload an app besides xCode now that impactor is down. I've tried to downgrade Xcode to fix this problem but because i'm on macOS Catalina 10.15.1 I can't go any lower unless someone knows a lower version of xcode available geared for 10.1
Sending them out works fine, friends and family receive them quickly and without issue. However, when they send them to me- they just show a little blue DL button and when I click it, it spins forever until it goes back to saying "download." 

Data is on (and unrestricted) for Messages. Download SMS and MMS is enabled. Battery saver is off. I have restarted my phone. I am up to date on both system and security updates. Same thing happens when the GIF is from Android / iPhone senders... 

r/Google pixel deleted my post with a picture, because "it was a pic of DMs." Well no duh guys! I'm trying to solve a problem in my DMs! Ffs... 

Any help y'all can provide is greatly appreciated 🙏🤗

Hi,

I recently fixed my iphone 8 screen by [screenrepairwellington.co.nz](https://www.screenrepairwellington.co.nz) and i paid $200 for that but today i dropped my phone on the road and screen got cracked again does anyone know New Zealand warranty policy. Do i need to pay again for my phone screen replacement?
The hotspot its it's awesome,  u can actually connect couple of tablets n laptop with no problem with my iphone.. but the service in marion north carolina its really bad,  i wish they improve the 4lte in the rural area in marion north carolina,  i went with visible cuz Verizon services are ok there but i went from bad to worse

I have an iPhone 8+ with the latest version of iOS and the new Car Play home screen/dashboard  (with multiple apps on the screen) will not appear. The other new Car Play features seem to work (like changing the screen on the phone without it changing the infotainment screen). 

My boyfriend has an XR and everything works as it should.

Does anyone else have a similar problem? Any potential fixes?
I currently have the iPhone X and was just wondering if it’s worth upgrading to the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Anybody upgrade?

So I play on iPhone 7 and have been playing on mobile since season three. As of last Thursday though, the game has been crashing much more frequently. First it was crashing whenever I tried to load into a game. I reinstalled it and then it now won’t even get to the blue loading screen. I hit play and it crashes about three to five second after. I have since sent a support ticket to epic but nobody has responded so I am turning to this sub. 

If anyone else has experienced this issue and has fixed it please let me know how you did it.

I got the iPhone 11, boujee I know, and I got the cod mobile app again and I can’t use 3D Touch... anyone know what im doing wrong, I don’t see the option. Same with PUBG mobile, options not there





Hello! I guess you guys read the title :) I’ve been an exclusive iPhone user for 6 years :) The last android phone I used was a LG G2.

I got sick of the iPhone and its limitations especially given its price point. I’m switching from an iPhone 8 to a Xiaomi Mi 9t. I was originally going to buy a Oneplus 7 pro because I was able to experience the 90Hz refresh rate when I borrowed my friends phone. However after seeing the Mi 9t and how you can install an 81Hz mod onto it I decided to buy it instead because its half the price of a Oneplus. 

So my question is, what should I first do after I boot my Mi 9t? Are there ways to uninstall the unnecessary bloatware? And how do I install the 81Hz mod on it? Thank you in advanced!

Hello, I just made a sale on eBay. I’m shipping an iPhone X. The buyer has requested first class shipping and I’m curious about the security of shipping it internationally. The shipping label shows exactly what’s in the box and the value, which seems like an invitation to steal it. With no insurance or any way to track it out of the US, I’m a little weary. Any help is greatly appreciated! The shipment is going to Armenia, if that helps.
 SLG closet sale! A few items to note:

* **Shipping:** Will ship anywhere in the US through USPS mail with tracking

**Gucci Crystal GG Clutch/WOC** \- $105

* Source: Purchased years ago from site called Gucci-Stores that no longer exists, for $250 with shipping.
* Selling Price: $105 (includes shipping and handling, tracking + my PP fees)
* Condition: Used twice, in mint like-new condition. Includes the bag and Gucci branded dustbag.
* I bought this before I knew much about reps and I made myself believe this was authentic. Sounds silly except that my friend had the auth version of this and when I stealthily compared it, this was identical to the touch. The materials felt the same to me. The differences were there are no serial numbers and I think the interior color is darker on this rep, and the zippers aren't smooth. I think the zipper can be easily fixed with wax, though I haven't tried that myself. This is Crystal GG, meaning it is coated canvas. I'm sure any liquid would slide right off without any problems making this an excellent bag candidate for bars, rainy days, or alternatively, perfect if you're around young children.
* Measures approx 8 inches wide x 5 inches in height. When opened, the bag is 9" H. Chain strap drop is 9". The full strap length is 21". The chain is fully removable to turn it into a clutch, or can be moved to one side to make it a wristlet. The bag has 2 zippered compartments, 1 open compartment, and 6 card slots.
* [My Photos](https://imgur.com/a/LAhh494)\- Could not locate the auth photo in this style but here is an [auth Gucci Crystal GG bag](https://www.yoogiscloset.com/handbags/gucci-beige-gg-crystal-coated-canvas-babouska-heart-clutch-bag-90303.html)

**Bottega Veneta zip around key case** \- $48

* Source: Purchased from TS Anna for 280cny + shipping + PP fees
* Selling Price: $48 (includes shipping and handling, tracking + my PP fees)
* Condition: Brand new. Includes the key case, care cards, and BV branded box and dustbag.

**Chanel Boy Cardwallet Crossbody phone case** \- $20

* Source: Purchased years ago (I mean, hello iphone 5) from a booth at an Asian fair for $60 (it was THAT cute, I couldn't resist).
* Selling price: $20 (includes shipping and handling, tracking + my PP fees)
* Condition: Good, used 3 times. Includes the cardwallet crossbody and the protective box.
* This is like a cute TB trinket, but thought some of the creative leather rehab folks could turn the phone part into a full cardholder/wallet, or maybe you actually have an iPhone 5s? This is likely not leather, but the "lambskin" is definitely soft. The chain is really light. The third and very last time I wore this I had a larger phone so I actually put a separate cardwallet inside where the phone would go and wore it as a mini purse/crossbody.
* Measurements just over 5 inches wide and 3 inches long. 9" wide when completely opened. 24" strap drop. Magnetic closure, 3 card slots and a side slot
* [My Photos](https://imgur.com/a/jSq0iMD)\- Auth likely never made but the [closest Auth version](https://www.chanel.com/us/fashion/p/A80603Y0765994305/boy-chanel-flap-card-holder-lambskin-gold-tone-metal/) on the exterior is the boy cardwallet

**Gucci Monogram Continental Canvas Metal Bar Wallet with Camel/Cognac Trim** \- $90

* Source: Purchased new on Ebay from a seller who specialized in Gucci, for $300. It was sold to me as an authentic item. The box and the style code and sticker details match, but to be candid, the quality seemed inferior to a full leather wallet I bought from Gucci when I was in Italy (that beautiful wallet was sadly stolen from me, I'll never get over that). That said, I found several recent sales of this style wallet (in overall worse condition for $200+) so not sure. I'm never confident about authenticity unless I buy it myself from the boutique.
* Selling price: $90 (includes shipping and handling, tracking + my PP fees)
* Condition: In overall good condition - there are parts in great condition and parts in poor condition. The interior leather where the card and bill slots are, is in great condition. The leather on the snap closure, metal hardware plate, and exterior canvas shows signs of wear (fair condition but a cleaning may fix that). The inside corners of the coin-purse/flap side is peeling (the "poor condition" part). This wallet has not been used for years and has been in the box the entire time, which might have caused the peeling. Please see photos for additional details.
* Measures approx 7.5 x 4 inches. Main part of the wallet has 12 cardslots and 5 long slots for bills or a checkbook, etc. The other side can be used for coins or other storage.
* Includes the wallet, original box, and care cards

Dumb question, but does anybody know a way to repair minor scratches on a phone with a glass screen? I have an iPhone 8+ if it makes any difference.
Guys. I need help after I installed Cydia or after I jailbroke my iPhone X btw running 13.2.2 my apps decided to not open or crash. Like snapchat it told me it detected that I had a tweak or a third party installed. I just wanted to know if there’s a way to bypass is ass well as other apps? Thanks:)
Every video on Instagram has no audio for me. I’ve made sure to tap to turn on sound, turn up my volume.. still nothing. It goes for igtv videos as well. I have an iPhone 8. Any ideas as to why? It just started today, everything was fine last night.
With many of my tweaks,  clicking the color option in the tweak settings does not give me the option to change the color.  For example, in "BatteryNotch", when I click the color, no color menu pops up.  Another example would be in "MessageColors".  Same issue.  Anyone else have this issue or am I missing something?

I just bought a refurbished iPhone 6s and it came with this blue flap behind the screen. I can't figure out how to remove it without damaging the phone. Help
Hello All ! Have a few phones to sell. Please to not hesitate to ask me any questions. Local is 72701. All prices are negotiable but please do not waste your time low balling. Shipping is included in the price. [Timestamps 1](https://imgur.com/a/ujuf7YQ) [Timestamps 2](https://imgur.com/a/fWNglw8)

I will price match if you believe you have found a similar phone currently listed at a better price. This would have to be from a fairly major site (eBay, swappa, nothing too obscure) and it must be an active listing.

Phones cannot be unlocked unless otherwise stated. All IMEI and serial number info is in the photos.

Iphone XS Max - Silver - 256 gb - AT&amp;T - 9/10 really good condition, may show minor signs of use, comes with box and charger - $640

iPhone 11 - Red - 64 gb - AT&amp;T - 10/10 brand new condition, comes with box and charger - $630

iPhone 11 - Red - 64 gb - AT&amp;T - 9/10 really good condition, may show minor signs of use, comes with box and charger - $610

Samsung S10+ - Blue - 128 gb - Sprint - 8/10 good condition, some light scratches on the back but other than that the phone is in nice shape - $480

Other:

iPad Pro 3rd gen - Silver - 12.9in - Cellular Unlocked - 9/10 really good condition, may show minor signs of use, comes with original box and accessories and also has a screen protector installed - $730

Bushnell tour V4 rangefinder - Great, working condition, comes with carrying case and protective cover - $150

Will consider trades for higher end electronics, keep in mind I have to factor in the logistics of reselling the item at your convenience.

If you would like to sell your phone pm me ! Looking for iPhone models 8 and up and will consider newer models of other brands. I will offer more than competitor sites like gazelle and cover shipping.

Thanks!


- Trying to decide which  messaging app to use on my Pixel.

- My significant other has an iPhone so we are looking for something with read receipts + currently typing visual indicator

- I'm currently deciding between Hangouts (wish it had a dark theme!), or Whatsapp (wish it wasn't run by Facebook!) 

If someone has any advice or suggestions on a different app please let me know. Thank you in advance!

From work I get an out of the box MacBook provided – privat enabled. However I have to install a JamF MDM-Profile on the machine.  
The Screenshot below shows the rights that are listed in the profile.

My question is now: Can I safely connect that laptop with my private iCloud? Because that helps me to use many nice workflows with my iPhone and also gives me access to some of my personal professional references and files that I have in my private iCloud.  


* I for example do not care about the "erase all data" or "lock screen" because my files are saved in iCloud anyways
* I do however care about my private pictures, that my iCloud obviously has access to. Can they access them through MDM on a MacBook that is logged into my iCloud?
* How far can they look into private apps that I install – e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram? Can they just see that they are there, or can they do more?
* Can they in any way see what's on my screen?
* How well and in what detail can they monitor my online history?
* What exactly is meant with "Application and media management"? How far are those rights going?

&amp;#x200B;

As said, I do NOT install the MDM-profile on a private MacBook (I would never do that), but on a company machine on which I myself had to enrol and install the MDM-profile. My question is aimed at understanding whether or not I want to connect this MacBook to my private iCloud or not and to understand how far the IT can look into this machine. The machines are officially "private enabled".
The specs for this on UI's site list its power rating as "5V/2A".  If I dig out an old iPhone charger, and an old iPad charger, they're both listed as 5V/2A - but the iPhone charger has 5W of power, and the iPad charger has 10W of power.

So, does anyone know what this UI toy will output - more like the iPhone charger or more like the iPad charger?  Thanks!

i have the black phone so i need the white apple logo ... if you're unsure how to find it in your files , it's under System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ProgressUI i believe and is called "apple-logo@3x~iphone.png" ... i had it saved in my Dropbox but for some reason the file is now corrupted and the apple logo disappeared from the photo lol. crazy i know. if anyone can share the original file with me or point me to it, it'd be much appreciated.


[SOLVED!]

I'm going to be buying an older apple watch for my sister for Christmas. She's very strictly an apple user and doesnt need nor want the latest and greatest, and wants a good value, but does still care about looks (plus I can't rly afford the newest watches.) And she's rocking an iphone 6 btw, tho she may soon upgrade to something like an 11 or XR, but idk for sure and it's best to assume that she may best stay with the 6 for another year or so. 

So which apple watch would you guys say has the best overall value? Specs, water resistance, looks, functionality, features, compatibility with her current phone, price, etc
I sold an iPhone on eBay which I described as unlocked and in decent condition. 

The buyer received the phone and it was not unlocked. This was an honest mistake on my part and I contacted my network and had it unlocked within 48 hours. To remedy this I offered to send her a £10 goodwill gesture. 

The buyer did not mark the item as received so I had to wait three weeks for the funds to become available on my PayPal. As soon as the funds were available I sent my goodwill gesture.

As soon as I sent the money to her she sent it back to me and immediately opened a return request against me claiming that "the phone has died twice at 40%" which never happened when I was using the phone. 

I did my research and realised I didn't have a leg to stand on really, as I'd mis-advertised the phone as unlocked and if it was escalated any higher, I would lose 99% . I conceded and was more than happy to offer her a partial refund through eBay so she could get a replacement battery, despite not having issues with it when I was in possession of the phone. She asked for £32.50 which I accepted and the case was closed.

This was on the 7/10/2019. 

I have today (12/11/2019) received a return request through my PayPal account from the same buyer for the initial payment that the item is "not as described" with the following message, bearing in mind I never had these issues when I had the phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hi I reported to you a battery problem and you very kindly refunded me partly to replace the battery. When I took it into the Apple shop the phone refused to power up using the power button. It only powered up when plugged in and then remained on even when power plug removed. Apple told me that the power button no longer works and refused to replace the battery. I am now stuck with a broken phone.

What's the best way to proceed? Surely I don't have to provide her with the refund as I have already partially refunded her through eBay? 

Some advice would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance :)

Hello!

My work recently introduced a new MDM and as such I deleted my work account from my iPhone (mainly because the mail app said it couldn’t connect to the mail server, which I now do through the outlook app that is now secured with the MDM). 

I was mistakenly thinking that my contacts were on my gmail account, so now they are gone from my iPhone. The contacts were mercifully preserved on my iPad from which I didn’t delete that work account. 

I would like to copy the contacts from the iPad back over to the iPhone, but don’t see a merge option using iCloud that I see on the Apple support page. Is there another method anyone knows? 

Thanks in advance!
Found the store on the darknet appleworld selling carded apple stuff, anybody used them😕

Hello,

I hope this is the right reddit for this. I’m not a novice when it comes to technology, but I’ve never owned a MacBook. I’m an adult student and need to get a more portable laptop to carry around campus, so I was hoping to get some advice.

I can’t fork over a ton of money, but I’m concerned that the specs of the baseline Pro, namely the 128GB and 8GB of RAM won’t be enough for me.

I will be using this laptop strictly for school work, but for me, that does include Adobe Creative Cloud. I’m also big on multi-tasking. I usually have numerous windows on my PC open at a time, one of which is usually a chrome window with at least 10 tabs when I’m doing research. 

I can’t spend a lot of money right now. Would the base Pro be enough? Ideally I’d like to get the 16GB and 256 SSD, but even with the student discount that’s almost $1600. 

Was hoping someone could give me real world, non-sales person advice. I currently do have a 2018 iPad Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, and a Razer Blade 15 PC (slim but heavy and high performance gaming laptop). 

Thank you!

Neal
I've got a brand new iPhone 11 and Airpods 2 (wireless charging). They work great when the phone is locked, but when I unlock it and actually use it, the audio frequently pops and glitches. It's still usable, but very annoying.

Help?
I deleted my original Snap a couple months ago because I don’t use it and I kept getting emails about once a week notifying me of an iPhone 7 in Washington accessing my account. I changed my password numerous times, setup two-factor authentication, and I *still* was having the issue after months of trying to combat it. 

I’ve NEVER had this kind of issue before, but this persistent person(?) kept winning. So I said screw it and deleted my account entirely, waited 30 days for it to be “official.” 

I’ve since created a new account and I just got the same damn email; someone in Washington accessing my new Snap via iPhone 7. What could the issue possibly be?

Edit: The recent email does not specify where it is beyond “near the United States.”

 Today as I was using my iPhone 6s at around 50% battery, it randomly  shut off and went to a black screen with the loading wheel turning. I  initially wasn't too worried as I thought my phone was just resetting  for whatever reason, but quickly realized it wasn't a short term  problem. It's now been about 4 hours later and the phone is still  showing a black screen with the circular loading wheel turning. I  understand a Force reset would be the best solution, however, my  physical home button has been broken for some time now thus rendering me  unable to do the Force Reset. Does anyone have any suggestions to help  me get my phone working again? Thanks so much!
I was wondering if anyone had any good HUD for the above phones. I have a 6s plus which I play on. Feel free to share any other phone hud which you think would be good. Images will be best.

\- it would be best if it works for small hands like mine and is primarily comfortable

\- really hope the HUD is good for winning cause I still need a solo win

(thanks a lot)

Wondering if anyone has tried to use multiple sets of these on an iPad or iPhone.  The AirPods and the beats work and Apple claims other may work just depends on the headphones.   Going on a long flight with the girlfriend and wanting to watch movies on our iPad together and the AirPods just don’t cut it.  Way to noisy on a plane.

The game has always worked perfectly on my phone but today it started randomly crashing every time I open it. I’m on iPhone 7, latest version of iOS. Anyone else have this problem or know how to fix it? I tried reinstalling but it didn’t work.


Anyone have experience returning a damaged phone after cancelling service? They told me I could also take it to an Apple store and have it repaired or replaced before returning it.
I downloaded a tweak that was not compatible with iOS 13 and it crashed the device. When I attempted to reset it, it was stuck in a bootloop.

I am on an iPhone 7+

Cheers!


Just got done waiting for a girl that was 2 hours late and spotted surfing SA (Online status).  She cancelled last two dates, so I should have been suspicious, she has gone radio silent now.  Second time this has happened to me since upgrading 10 days ago.

I am usually pretty good about ID verifying (ask for a selfie where their face is visible and make the peace sign), but I guess I let my guard down on this one, never again.  (I use Google Pixel 4XL so iPhone facetime is not an option)

Must be a lot of hurt girls trying to seek their revenge on unsuspecting guys by creating free fake accounts on a website that does not make photo verification a requirement.

My friend has an issue on his iPhone x because since he once dropped it ,his face ID hasn't been working so he went to the Apple store they said to back it up and restart it after he did it still didn't work so is there any way that it can be fixed by himself

So I just downloaded Epic Seven onto my pc, and I want to transfer my data from my iPhone onto it. I have a Google play account on my phone (on Epic Seven I mean), but I can’t find a way to transfer it. And it won’t let me open Epic Seven on Google play (it’s there, I just can open the app) Is there any way to transfer it? I’ll take any tips UwU

I downloaded the Disney+ app this morning and it’s using a ton of data. I’ve watched maybe 4 Simpsons episodes on my iPhone (cellular data) and used 1.4 GB. My playback setting is set to Save Data.

Anyone else noticing this app is eating a huge amount of their data? Not sure what’s going on - it’s kind of concerning. 

FYI - I’m tracking my data usage under the Cellular section on my iPhone (under iOS settings).
I'm still dealing with this right this moment so this wall of text may jump all around, I may try and edit this later.

Me and my wife live on the third floor of an apartment. There are two units on each floor. Small shitty apartments in North Jersey. There are 3 floors and 1 basement unit. There are two front doors to the building, an unsecured one, than our mailboxes in a small hallway, than a self closing/locking door.

**1st Robbery**

Came home to my door being slightly opened. Immediately noticed something was wrong. It was very obvious that someone kicked my door in. They stole some cash that was sitting on the coffee table right in front of where the front door opens. I call my landlord to tell her, And she immediately starts blaming us with lines like , " I've owned the building for 25 years and have never had an issue, IT HAS to be someone you guys know", My biggest mistake here was not filling a police report. I was/am naive. All in all he stole about 100 dollars. Didn't touch the 55 inch TV right there.

After the first robbery i told my landlord i was going to get a security camera for my front door and i took that out of rent. I was doing the right thing and got the cheapest one without a subscription. This comes to bite me in the ass for the second robbery.

**2nd Robbery**

This time the thief doesn't kick my door in, instead he just takes the electric razor scooter that is right near my front door. My camera 100% recorded him but me and the wife didn't notice till 8 days later. my security camera over writes files that are 7+ days old. Fuck me right. No footage of this robbery.

**3rd Robbery (11/11/2019)**

Came home at my usual time, to notice that the bait( and item i put on our landing to entice a thief[an empty iPhone case]) I had set was gone. Since the second robbery ive been checking the cameras daily and BOOM, we got him on camera.

I call the cops, give them the file, Tell my land lord about this THIRD robbery. She feeds me the same line of " I've owned the building for 25 years and haven't had anyone robbed, don't know why they're choosing you" I tell her, Listen, it doesn't fucking matter what you say or how many years you've been trouble free, IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACTS. the fact is, under her land lording, we have been robbed and violated 3 times. She has done nothing. She says shes shes sending her husband tomorrow to change the locks in the front door.

I have notified her via text messages multiple times that the front door isn't locking itself 100% of the time. That alls it takes is one lucky time for a thief to get back in the building. She still has yet to replace the mechanism that auto shuts the door.

The first time we were robbed she said via a text message that she would change the front door locks and install security cameras. She never did either of those things. It took us 3 times of getting robber for her to admit that she needs to change the front door locks.

PLEASE HELP ME. PLEASE TELL ME THERE IS SOMETHING I CAN LEGALLY DO AGAINST HER. This has been the biggest nightmare of my life. I have never felt so unsafe and violated in my own home. My wife is terrfied to be home alone and i don't blame her.


Hi, I’m hoping someone can help me retrieve/recover an instagram message I apparently got sent to me, but it was “unsent”? 
I have no clue who it’s from
The last iOS I ever used was iOS 7 on the iPhone 4s, you could probably tell that I switched to android for phones. But ipad os is amazing, everytime I think, "hmm I wonder if I can do this" it actually can now!

Just an amazing software combined with the iPad Pro 2018. 

My 2 favourite features so far are how EASY it is to side load my music and video collection from my PS3, and desktop browsing is why I will never use the YouTube app.
It’s working again in iOS 13.3 beta 2, released today, so will be available to all shortly. It may have affected only a few iPhone models, my XR being one of them.
Anyone has been having issues with the game yesterday and today with constant crashing of the game, especially on Clash and Battle Park Battles? 

I am running the game on an iPhone with IOS Software 13.2
Will I be able to play Stadia on my iPhone after the early access phase?
I just recently jailbroke my iPhone 6 running iOS 12.4.3 using checkra1n and I was simply wondering if anyone has any recommended tweaks and/or repos that are available for my device and iOS version.

Sorry if it's a dumb or repetitive question.
I have been with AT&amp;T since 2004 as I looked at plans today to trim some fat from my budget I looked at competitor pricing and it looks like I could save a ton of money with sprint (My sister and parents have sprint so I’m familiar with the customer service and signal levels) I’m just hoping to see if I’m missing any discounts or anything- customer service wasn’t helpful and didn’t even offer a limited time retention discount. 

Current plan: unlimited &amp; more from the Summer $75 plus $35 access for two smartphones and $20 for an iPad

The two iPhone XR’s have 17 payments left ($33 each) 

A whopping total of $245 a month. 

AT&amp;T unlimited starter for this situation would be $206/month before taxes etc. 

I am looking to bring that down a bit. 

In terms of the premium services add onsI have a full tv package paid for by my landlord so I don’t need the att watch service. I do pay for Spotify, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. 
 

Sprint is offering 
$100 per month unlimited basic. Plus they’d cover my Hulu subscription. 

Or 

$120 per month plus lease one get one of $15 for new iPhone 11s with clean slate/trade of our XRs- plus Hulu. 



Am I missing something that makes staying with AT&amp;T a better option? (Other than signal strength in certain areas, we don’t travel much)

Hello All ! Have a few phones to sell. Please to not hesitate to ask me any questions. Local is 72701. All prices are negotiable but please do not waste your time low balling. Shipping is included in the price. [Timestamps 1](https://imgur.com/a/ujuf7YQ) [Timestamps 2](https://imgur.com/a/fWNglw8)

I will price match if you believe you have found a similar phone currently listed at a better price. This would have to be from a fairly major site (eBay, swappa, nothing too obscure) and it must be an active listing.

Phones cannot be unlocked unless otherwise stated. All IMEI and serial number info is in the photos.

If you would like to sell your phone pm me ! Looking for iPhone models 8 and up and will consider newer models of other brands. I will offer more than competitor sites like gazelle and cover shipping.

Thanks!
ICleaner resets my preferences. (Apps want location,mic,access to photos) and after running iCleaner my apps disappear until I reboot and rejailbreak. How do I make it not reset those and from making apps disappear? 


iOS 12.4 iPhone 8+ on unc0ver.
 SD19 , I don't expect much tbh, my thing is do stuff around the house help, and go to work/college we good. Well her BD and my SO preach about her not being responsible, but yet they give/gave her everything she asked for. Now "she's moving out of her (BD)" , I find out some of it is her being not responsible. Well let's see, BD pays her cell, most her car insurance, bought her new iPhone and now find out her gym membership wtf... Aggravating lol

People connect with us because buying Lovebay Christmas Phone Cases For iPhones and Christmas Circle Wall Hanging Ornament is like a badge that says, “I did something for someone and I love doing it for my self.” Do it for your self and other too with Christmas Bundle at low price.
I’ll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible. I’m typing this all out on my iPhone so I apologize for any complications understanding the story. I live in a very nice urban neighborhood with a lot of small businesses for reference. 

Back on August 1st I moved into my first apartment. When I moved in the apartment was disgusting, walls were dirty, under the stove and kitchen in general was not cleaned up..etc. no big deal, I’m going to say something but I’m not gonna make a big deal out of it. I cleaned it up and went about my business. My oven just so happened to be making a weird noise and I smelled gas every item I had it running. Made a complaint 3 times, no fix. Just a shady drunk who claims is a maintenance man, comes in whenever he feels like telling me there is no issue. Finally the owner shows up with him on my final complaint, to basically tell what I’m complaining about doesn’t exist. Even though a strong whiff of gas is present when I run my oven and a high pitched frequency. Refuses to fix it/replace it even though the guests in my apartment agree with me when I show them my issue. SURPRISINGLY NOT WHAT IM HERE FOR...

So keep in mind that the only utilities I am responsible to pay is for electricity. Meaning everything else, including heat, is included in my rent, as stated on the lease. I pay for my rent a month in advanced, and have never been late or missed a rent payment. This slumlord has refused to answer my calls,texts, emails..etc. I can never get ahold of anyone for any issues, and the proof is all in the pictures. Temperatures in Wisconsin have dropped since the end of September. I have attached a calendar with the weather. I went the whole month of October without heat in my apartment, to then finding out at the end of the month that the heat was turned on in the beginning of October, my unit was just not receiving heat due to a faulty boiler(this is what I was told by the drunk maintenance man on Saturday, October 26th. The first and only time anyone has came in to check my apartment for the issue with my heat. And now I’m being blamed for breaking the thermostat even though I clearly said I didn’t take apart the thermostat to even change the batteries, which I end up doing to try and it still did not work. Heat started working magically on the 29th which is a Tuesday when I came home on break from work. This is why his story does not make sense once you read the texts. How is it I broke the thermostat? I only talked to one person about this issue of my heat and was told the boiler. He claims a “professional” said I broke the thermostat. Aka bullshit. If he did really get a professional, had to of entered my property without notice because I never was made aware of any of that which explains my text[proof](https://imgur.com/a/w99jYBJ). I believe this is part of his shady slimy slumness games to get out of 1) dealing with me and 2) taking some money off my deposit to go towards the broken boiler. 

The messages between me and another tenant I know mutually through my sister and between the landlord and I are dated and in order. Please give me some advice on what I can do legally to fight back as a tenant against this shitty landlord. Breaking the lease is one option but I would also like to know if there is anything monetary wise against him.
I installed the correct IPSW for my device, and I even tried downloading the restore file through iTunes, but it still says my iPhone is incompatible with the firmware. Any help?
Today I found out that in settings that my SIM card was apparently missing, and when I click on the mobile data tab it becomes blank. Is there anything that could cause this to happen?

I'm using the same iPhone 7 I have used before to spoof and suddenly I am getting this message when I try to install the .ipa file. Any help is greatly appreciated!
~~This is my first time jailbreaking. While trying to install Unc0ver for the first time on this (used) iPhone SE ios 12.1.4 I just got off ebay I get this error: 
"file: installer.cpp; line: 71; what: 
_assert(!teams.empty())"
I have tried revoking XCode certificates and it hasn't helped. I get the same error message no matter what ipa I try to load. I have tried with unc0ver 3.7, 3.6.3, chimera, and the install cydia extender option. 
I do not have 2 step verification enabled, and this is the first time jailbreaking this phone (at least after receiving it on a fresh restore.)
Thanks for any help~~

EDIT: thanks to the discord for letting me know that it's a universal issue with cydia
I bought an Apple USB camera adaptor so I can use my Blue Snowball Ice USB microphone on my iPhone 6s. But when I try to connect it it says “Accessory Unsupported: The attached accessory uses too much power. I am trying to make YouTube videos of higher quality and can only use my iPhone because I don’t have a PC. I have been using Apple earbuds and they have worked fine so it is not the most important thing to get this fixed. I am just pissed that I had to waste $35 on an adaptor that is useless to me. It worked last night when I tested it for a short while, but then it stopped working. I have a jailbroken iPhone 6s on iOS 12.4. Thanks.
Out of sudden as I was using my iPhone my jailbreak tweaks were tripping and so i restarted my iPhone and then i couldn’t enter uncover. I was pressing the trust button on the profile settings but it wasn’t working. Stressed out with this shitty uncOver jailbreak.
Before you downvote, hear me out. I owned iPhones up until the 5s then got bored and decided to switch to Android. I owned many different makes and models, but more specifically, I had every iteration of the Google Pixel (OG XL, 2, 2 XL, 3 XL, and 4 XL). The Pixel was plagued with issues, both software and hardware, but there was one thing you could always count on - that incredible camera.

After getting fed up with my issue-plagued Pixel 4XL, I returned it and decided to give iPhone a try again. From a hardware standpoint, this phone is absolutely excellent. The haptics are amazing, the software (though hard to adjust to again) is smooth, and everything just works well together.

But then there’s the camera...*sigh*...is it *really* this bad compared to the Pixel? The great thing about the Pixel was that you didn’t have to fiddle with the settings; you take out the phone, take a picture, and nine times out of ten you get a wonderful shot. The iPhone, on the other hand, I only manage to get one to two good shots out of ten or so. Portrait mode is terrible at separating foreground from background. Manual adjustment for f-stop is cool, but who has time, especially when you’re trying to capture quick photos of the kids? The white balance is consistently warmish, almost yellow. There’s no autofocus tracking like the Pixel offers. There’s a significant amount of noise not only when using the ultra-wide and telephoto lenses, but also in close up shots. Night mode makes my photos appear as they were taken in the day time. The list goes on...

I honestly want to love this phone, but the photography is really a disappointment. The video capability is absolutely amazing, but I seldom take videos. I’ve tried looking up different articles and YouTube videos on the camera settings, but I’m not learning anything that I couldn’t already figure out on my own. Honestly, am I doing something wrong here? I consider myself to be pretty tech savvy, so I’m starting to get a little frustrated with my experience with this phone’s camera so far. Any other Pixel converts out there with a similar experience?

Any tips/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
Like 20 minutes ago I sniped a Gible and it was working fine, the next time I tried to open iSpoofer an error popped saying that my iPhone doesnt trust the app. I unistalled the app, reinstaled and trusted the app, but know it says that I need an Internet conection. :/

My Internet is fine, is rebooted the phone, unistalled... Idk whats happening. Should I try the other dowload links from the wen?

Im new to iOS and iSpoofer so sorry if this is a stupid question
