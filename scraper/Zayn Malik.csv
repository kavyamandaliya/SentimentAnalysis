https://t.co/5mVpMwSS4x
Let me preface this by saying that I kept up with this years ago as it was happening, and, as such, I haven't been able to find a lot of the sources from back then, as many people have changed blogs or deleted altogether. If you were more involved and can source/correct some of this information, feel free, unless you were a tin-hatter, in which case I really, really question your sources.


So: this drama combines two of the wildest kinds of fandoms- boy band superfans, and tin-hatters, who not only shipped two IRL people but believed they were secretly dating and forbidden from announcing it by some shadowy, evil management figure. The tin-hatting fandom around Louis Tomlinson and Harry Styles of One Direction (called "Larries") is one of the most, er, passionate I've ever seen. Top hits include sending NSFW art of Louis and Harry together to Louis's underage sister, believing Louis's girlfriend Eleanor was actually [a set of triplets](https://larryisnotreals.tumblr.com/post/45857567540/eleanor-tinagretchen-calder) acting as his beard(s), and being invasive enough that Harry and Louis said Larries had [affected their friendship](https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/a10350811/louis-tomlinson-confirms-that-larry-shippers-ruined-his-deep-friendship-with-harry-styles/). 


2015 was a wild time for the One Direction fandom as a whole. First, Louis broke up with Eleanor, leading Larries to speculate that, with "Louis's beard(s)" gone, he and Harry would finally be allowed by Shadowy Evil Management to come out of the closet. Then, Zayn Malik left, the band went on hiatus, and in the middle of it all, shit really hit the fan when a woman named Briana announced she was pregnant with Louis's kid- a scandal referred to as Babygate by those who believe the whole thing is fake. 


Obviously, Babygate didn't work well with the theory that Louis was secretly gay and in a long-term relationship with Harry. And while girlfriends could be written off as beards, and rebuttals from Louis and Harry as scripted by management, a baby was harder to ignore...or so you'd think. 


Larries spent the next few months in denial. The pregnancy wasn't real until management confirmed it, until Louis confirmed it, until he confirmed it in an interview instead of just on social media, etc- all of this happened. Then, Larries turned to picking apart Briana's body for signs that she was faking the pregnancy. One picture was taken that, because of the angle, made it hard to see her bump. They immediately took this as proof that she wore a fake bump, and had somehow forgotten it in a picture posted publicly on Instagram. This continued after the baby was born, when everyone became experts on what a woman's body should and shouldn't look like after birth. They ignored any photos that went against their belief and spread the ones that made her look "too thin to have just given birth" like wildfire. This was a common pattern with Larries- with Louis and Eleanor and any other girlfriends, they'd ignore pictures where the couple looked happy, and spread the ones taken at unflattering angles as proof the couple was actually fake and miserable.


(There was also, briefly, a theory that Briana would have [a fake miscarriage to end the fake pregnancy](https://failedlarrypredictions.tumblr.com/post/186268009007/i-remember-when-the-pregnancy-was-announced-and). Fun stuff.)


Finally, Louis's baby was born- a boy, named Freddie. This led to even more denial. "It's not real because they haven't posted any pictures!" A few black-and-white photos surfaced. "Well, the pictures aren't in color, so they're photoshopped!" Color photos were posted on social media. "Well it's not a video, so it's not proof!" Paparazzi stalking Louis and Briana got a video of Freddie crying. "Well, it's still not a good video, he could just be a doll!" Louis posted a video of Freddie kicking a toy. It was pretty obvious to everyone with eyes that this baby was real, and that Louis was helping take care of him and happy to have him around.


This still wasn't enough, however. Some Larries remained on the hyperrealistic baby doll theory, claiming that Freddie's movement in videos was unnatural and obviously doll-like. This theory became harder and harder to believe as more content of Freddie was posted, so most switched to a new one- that Shadowy Evil Management had hired Briana as a beard, faked her pregnancy, paid off another couple to use their real baby in social media posts and paparazzi shots, all while also employing Louis's then-girlfriend Danielle as yet another, simultaneous beard. 

(You'd think management could've saved money by hiring an already-pregnant woman in Briana's place, using her baby, and having Louis pretend to date her. It'd be a one-stop-shop instead of an entire operation involving a fake mother, two real parents, a fake baby, and a fake girlfriend.)


Denial continued, along with a lot of anger directed at Briana and whoever they believed Shadowy Evil Management was at the time (it's important to note that Louis went through some management changes around then after leaving 1D, so Shadowy Evil Management had to change identities). Nothing Briana or Louis did was ever enough. If they posted pictures, they were obviously rubbing it in everyone's faces and desperate to prove Freddie was real, so Freddie had to be fake. If they didn't post pictures, then it was obviously fake because parents love to post pictures of their kids online. If Louis talked about Freddie in an interview, he was obviously faking enthusiasm and trying to hide how miserable he was, and why couldn't the media just focus on his music? If he didn't talk about Freddie, then it was obviously fake because why wouldn't he talk about his kid?


On top of this, they criticized every one of Briana's parenting decisions (that they could infer from her social media posts) and accused her of neglect, which seems completely unnecessary if Freddie was just someone else's baby hired out for a few photos and videos every now and then. They hate-stalked her social media, and she was called a lot of names that rhyme with "bold-bigging bore" (despite her apparently just being an employee of Shadowy Evil Management, not the actual mastermind behind it). 


There's so much more down this rabbit hole that I've only scratched the surface. 


* One fan got Louis's personal phone number, called him, and told him she hoped Freddie died. 

* Another fan bought a hyperrealistic baby doll and made her own Instagram account where she imitated all of Louis and Briana's pictures with her doll, to...prove they were fake? Make fun of the baby? 

* The same fan bought a bunch of URLs related to Briana's family and started websites trying to prove Freddie was fake, after submitting her "proof" to several tabloids and being ignored. Briana's family ended up suing her (the websites were incredibly antagonistic towards Briana). 

* Yet another fan drove several hours to the county where Freddie was born to see if a birth certificate actually existed for him. Surprise surprise, it did.

* A well-known Larry who made popular "proof" compilations had a username related to Freddie Mercury. Some decided Louis had deliberately named Freddie as an acknowledgment of that Larry, and a hint that Freddie wasn't actually his son. This in spite of the fact that apparently Shadowy Evil Management had so much control over him that they could force him to act like a father to a fake baby. 

* At one point (I can't remember if it was before this or during), it came out that many of the most popular Larries were part of a group chat, and, whenever Louis or Harry got pap'd doing something that went against their theory, the popular Larries all worked together to fill everyone's newsfeed with very pro-Larry stuff as a distraction, so no one would see the paparazzi photos.

* There were also constant predictions that "all the clues point to #Babygate ending on x date!" that would immediately be forgotten when nothing happened on x date. For a big list of these predictions, check out [failedlarrypredictions](https://failedlarrypredictions.tumblr.com/) which started back in 2015 to remind people how many predictions had failed, and is *still going* because there are still people out there making predictions.

Freddie, in case you're wondering, is now about three and a half, and Louis still claims to be his father and has still not come out as gay or secretly dating Harry Styles. The Larry fandom has dwindled, but they're still around, or else have moved onto other tin-hatting fandoms.

I really wish I could find sources for more of these incidents because I recognize that some of them are fairly unbelievable. If you want to go further down the Larry rabbit hole, though, I recommend you check out [this post](https://contemplatingoutlander.tumblr.com/post/165330753522/this-is-not-your-fathers-larry-mega-masterpost)- it's a master post of debunks of Larry "clues". A lot of the links are broken as blogs have moved or deleted, but it's still a good collection of Larry theories up until about the birth of Freddie, and why those beliefs were all, in fact, bullshit. 

**TL;DR:** Confirmation bias &amp; willful ignorance are stretched to their limits by an infant. 

(And if you still genuinely believe in Larry in 2019...I'm not interested in a debate, the debunks are out there, and Freddie isn't going anywhere).
Not counting Zayn Malik so it's an even 4v4


The music playing for the fight is Papa Roach
Edit again for more in-depth details.

The 1D boys are now more or less in the sophomore phase of their solo careers. Zayn has released a second album while Niall and Harry are about to release theirs. Liam and Louis have yet to release albums but have been regularly releasing singles. The sophomore phase is generally where people judge the real potential and success of an artist, to see whether they were a one-hit wonder or not. For former band members there's also the factor if whether or not they can make it on their own. This is a topic that has been discussed for the likes of the Beatles, Spice Girls, Nsync, Kpop groups and Jonas Brothers for example. One Direction is without a doubt the biggest boyband of the 2010's era so this discussion is unavoidable in pop culture. Interestingly enough, all of the boys have enjoyed solo success in varying degree with none being the clear Justin Timberlake of their group. That said one is clearly enjoying more success than the other and it's interesting to discuss that. 

My basis of success are revenue, media presence, public awareness and potential for long-term success. I count their endeavors both music and non-music related as well. Here are my analysis for each of their solo careers, take note I'm not really a One Direction fan, I'm no hater and like some of their songs but I was never into them. I like the solo music Harry, Zayn and Niall are producing and its just fan analyzing this kind of stuff. 

Zayn Malik 

Strengths: The one with the most potential. Arguably the second most popular among non 1D fans nowadays. Had all the qualities to become a superstar upon his debut. All eyes were on him as the guy who left the band, even non-fans were curious to what kind of music he'll be releasing. Pillowtalk was a smash both with critics and charts, Mind of Mine also sold well. He had the high profile relationship that kept him relevant over the years. He is very good looking, that certainly helps him. I don't want to live forever was also huge, but I would count that more on Taylor Swift's influence. He has some fashion endorsements including a partnership with Versus Versace. This year he also sang for Disney's live action Aladdin and that gave him a good amount of spotlight and radio play. His name is still fairly popular and the one least associated with One Direction. Pillowtalk is still fairly popular today as well. 

Weakness: His mental health and anxiety is really holding him back. It's unclear what kind of career he actually wants now, during his debut he clearly wanted superstardom, he has recently tweeted about doing a tour, but nowadays he just randomly pops up whenever. Icarus Falls was a flop and none of his recent songs (except A Whole New World which would have done well anyway because of Disney) have gained momentum. He also doesn't seem to have the right industry connections and doesn't play the game that much. 

Harry Styles 

Strengths: The fan favorite and most popular of the group, usually the only name non 1D fans actually know. Has the critical acclaim and a very loyal fanbase who loves promoting him. The media also adores him, like they love making a big deal out of him. He has the best selling album and a had a very successful tour. Considering album and ticket sales are a much bigger revenue generator than streams, this makes him a very profitable artist for his label and ensures that he will be a priority artist. His name generates buzz as the example with the Little Mermaid casting. He is currently the face of Gucci, one of the biggest fashion brands in the world. He has been the co-chair of this year's Met Gala, one of the most talked about events in fashion and Hollywood. Sign of the Times is used a lot for shows and promos and that has gotten the song attention and sales even two years after its release. For the sophomore phase, Lights Up seems to be doing the best in terms of streaming. The actual numbers and lasting power is yet to be judged, but its looking to be his best performing single streaming wise. 

Weakness: Has the second lowest streaming and radio play out of all of them. None of his songs from the first album had the quality to be popular with the charts. Radio play is a great way for non fans to discover you so despite not being the biggest revenue generator, it is still an important aspect. He does promo but quite limited. He likes to withdraw himself from fans and social media which doesn't help his engagement, and is very selective on which interviews and promo he wants to participate in. 

Niall Horan

Strengths: Loved by most people. Slow Hands was a huge hit and performed very well on charts. He has a lot of friends in the industry, which really helped him stay relevant in the tabloids. Flicker sold really well. Nice to Meet Ya is also doing alright although nothing compared to Slow Hands. He is playing in a lot of events and regularly releases new singles that have all had decent success. He has the best fan engagement and overall the most likeable personality wise. He also has the least amount of controversy associated with him which is really good for his image. 

Weakness: His concert wasn't a big success, with a lot of venues not close to being sold out. He has a lot of celebrity friends, but the media doesn't seem to hype him as much as Harry or Zayn. He also has the least non-music related success. 

Liam Payne

Strengths: The best in terms of streams and charts, maybe on par with Zayn. His music is more in tune with what's popular today so this isn't surprising. Strip that Down was a huge success. His other singles weren't as big but as others have pointed they did well outside the US. He has a great deal with Hugo Boss which includes two partnerships and his fashion career seems to be doing well. He is doing a lot of events, they're not all huge but it still helps him promote his music. He also regularly does interviews so his name is always out there.

Weakness: Seems to have the biggest fanbase out of all five. A lot of people fans and non fans alike think he tries too hard, a lot of people found Strip that Down cringy but catchy nonetheless. Has a lot of controversy following him, especially regarding his relationships. A lot of people are also unfamiliar with him despite his success with the charts. He also doesn't look like he'll be releasing an album anytime soon. 

Louis Tomlinson

Strengths: The X-factor gig made him relevant in the UK at least. None of his singles are huge but they have some decent success. He has plenty of high profile interviews. The most loyal fanbase out of the five that does a lot of promo work for him. His football team also seems to be doing well, so overall I think his non-music ventures are doing great. 

Weakness: Probably the least popular for non fans right now. Music wise the least successful. His music career is hampered by the multitude personal problems that plague him. I'm glad he seems to be doing well despite all that, but it really did hinder his potential. His label doesn't promote him that much as well. 

I wrote more about Harry and Zayn because they have the most activities and analysis surrounding them, but feel free to add more details. This isn't about bias, but there are really more information about those two members. 

Music wise since in terms of revenue album and ticket sales generate more, I have to give Harry the success. Next is Niall, then Zayn, then Liam and then Louis. 

Non music activities Harry then Zayn followed closely by Liam, Louis and then Niall.

Media presence and public awareness: Harry and Zayn are probably equal, then Liam and Niall are also pretty equal, last is Louis. 

Long term success: Harry and Niall but their levels of success differ but nonetheless they're in it for the long run. Next is Louis if he keeps up with the X-factor and he seems to have a pretty stable career. I put Liam after Louis because he can't seem to get his shit together. Zayn is last for now. 

Feel free to use your own metric for success.

Guys, Hannah said in her latest ET interview that she's ready for men to DM her. Eventhough she doesn't need a man, she deserves one! Even if it's a short term thing. So, let's get our girl a fine ass man! Which celebrities do you think would be good for her? Now taking taking suggestions!

PS: This is not a serious post. Just for fun! But, it'll also be cool if we can somehow miraculously make it happen! üòÇ

Edit: Someone suggested Zayn Malik and I'm all for it. They don't even have to date. They can just hang. Omg, the frenzy it would cause. Can we just put that out to the universe, please? K, thanks!
Last month, EXMNA held a weekend full of events in Toronto. Our highlight was the Saturday Night party potluck with open mic talent show and a dance floor where Zayn Malik made an appearance. He was taking pictures with the ladies and bobbing up and down to the beats (see pics below).

People from all over North America registered to attend. Many had to be turned away at registration; we simply had too many people wanting to register, and we quickly hit capacity.

EXMNA routinely holds what can easily be deemed the largest ex-Muslim gatherings on the planet. Indeed, the ex-Muslim movement more broadly, is growing. It‚Äôs not all parties though. The real world friendships provide support, community, and a sense of belonging. Our security screenings give you the peace of mind to meet other like-minded people.

Were you once Sunni, Shia, Sufi? Perhaps Ithna Asheri, Ismaili, or Ahmadi? More than one of the above? We‚Äôve got you covered. Every flavor of the Ummah was represented and in attendance, including sects everyone else used to think were ‚Äúnon-Muslim Kafirs‚Äù.

We are all now equal as brothers and sisters in this new, rapidly growing ex-Muslim Ummah :)

More and more ex-Muslims have tackled the difficult conversations and circumstances here in the West. More of us are showing our faces and speaking up. But even if you‚Äôre private about your apostasy, you‚Äôll have peace of mind in our private meetups. They were tailor made for you.

Don‚Äôt worry, we won‚Äôt take photos of you and post them without your permission. In all of the photos we‚Äôre sharing here today, every single person was asked for their prior permission.

You can see the bonds of friendship, happiness, and community. It‚Äôs yours to have again, and this time, as your authentic self. Connect with people who understand your journey, because your story is often their story‚Äîour story.

&amp;#x200B;

[ We are so excited that Zayn Malik decided to make an appearance at his first ever Exmoosapalooza! More pictures below!](https://preview.redd.it/e0j1blqmgma21.jpg?width=1224&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4ff2018be803c6a0096234587f6154c79ee034b)

Join us!

If you‚Äôre not yet a member of EXMNA, get yourself on the calendar now. The process usually takes a few weeks. And so if you want to be a member before the next meetup in a city near you, get scheduled for a screening today!

Here‚Äôs how. Go to [http://exmuslims.org/join-us](http://exmuslims.org/join-us) and pick a time slot on the calendar.

Your new community awaits!

2 guys asked me out, the manager from the restaurant next door invited me to see his band (he's 40 and im 19...) and then a grown woman came in with a cardboard cutout of Zayn Malik and sat it across from her. Thank god i only have a 3-hour shift today.

Theres been a few articles I'll link below, but to name a few: Justin Bieber, Pete Davidson, Frank ocean, Chris brown, Tyga, Kanye West, Zayn Malik, Trevor Wallace, Blackbear, g eazy, etc. Is this the sign of the mk ultra? Why?

Thanks for reading! Been thinking about this for a while.


This did not happen today. It happened about a year ago, but I‚Äôm still thinking about it. 

For the past couple years I‚Äôve struggled with very severe depression. The day this happened, my mood was starting to improve, and my sense (or lack) of humor was coming back. 

My mom was driving and I was sitting in the passenger seat. The song ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Wanna  Live Forever‚Äù by Taylor Swift and Zayn Malik started playing, and as much as I dislike that song, I knew my mom liked it, so I didn‚Äôt say anything. 

The dashboard on my mom‚Äôs car has a character limit for the length of song titles, and at this moment, the dashboard read ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna live‚Äù. I laughed and took a picture of it and posted it on my Snapchat story with the caption ‚Äúsame‚Äù. Mind you, everyone I have on there is depressed in some sense of the word, and they all know me and that I joke like this often. 

Well, I forgot that my cousins that I don‚Äôt see very often could view my story. My mom asked me to run into the grocery store, and as I was leaving the store, I realized my mom was talking with one of my cousins through the car Bluetooth. My cousin had called my mom to ask if I was alright, and my mom was confused because she doesn‚Äôt have Snapchat and didn‚Äôt see what I had posted. She told my mom that my joke was not funny and that if I wanted to post things like that, I would have to put ‚Äòlol‚Äô or an emoji so people didn‚Äôt think I was serious. When I got back into the car, I was blessed by being yelled at by both my mom and my cousin, who‚Äôs voice was booming through all the car speakers at a volume of 40. My mom was driving very slowly as she was pulling away from the store, so I decided that I didn‚Äôt want to deal with this bs and I got out. Unfortunately, I am very uncoordinated, so I fell on the ground, and now I have a scar to forever remind myself that I‚Äôm not funny.  

tl;dr made a dumb depression joke, didn‚Äôt use üòÇ, got yelled at by my mom and cousin, ended up jumping out of a moving car and now I have a huge scar.
So I went over to this guy's place after about a week of talking to him. We both were looking for something serious and thought we had a lot in common. He even expressed to me that he wanted me to be his girlfriend and I thought it was too good to be true that he wanted me like that. He was very sweet and honestly the most attractive guy that has ever shown interest in me, he was legit a Zayn Malik doppelganger. He seemed like a great guy apart from his looks and that's the only reason why I agreed to meet him irl.

Anyways the day finally arrives and I get to his apartment and things are fine he hugs me and tells me I'm pretty. We get to his couch to watch some TV but he immediately starts kissing me. He eventually takes me to his room to make out. He then took off his clothes and one thing led to another. We were really into it and I accidentally cut his penis while giving him a handjob and it started to bleed out pretty bad. Things were really awkward after that. We had to clean off his blood from the bathroom floor and put bandages on his penis to stop the bleeding. I felt terrible and  apologize profusely to the point where it got annoying hearing me say sorry so much.

Afterwards we tried to pretend like nothing happened by ordering pizza and watching a movie and it was fine but the date was already ruined IMO. Things were really awkward and we didn't have much to talk about so we just browsed through Netflix in complete silence. He called out the elephant in the room by saying things aren't going great and I agreed and felt like it was my fault the date was ruined. BUT he reassures me that its fine and we're good.

He eventually mentioned something he liked that I did with my mouth and asked if I could do it again. I said yes and we went to his bedroom to have some more fun or at least tried to because his penis was sore and bleeding. We didn't have sex because I was on my period and he was bleeding from his penis. We were okay with this and still choose to make out and feel on each other without having sex. Throughout the night it was pretty hard to sleep mainly because his dick was hard and I just felt had too much anxiety. He kept caressing my body and holding me close to him so we could cuddle or kiss. I thought finally he was over what happened and started being the caring guy I was falling for.

Fast forward to the next morning we are okay but something feels off. Anyways I thought it could be resolved if we discussed it later. While I was getting ready to leave I hug him and kiss him one last time while he lays in bed. I asked him if he was still interested in me and he tells me yes and I told him I was worried that you would ghost me after what I did and he jokingly told me maybe to which I responded wow thanks for the reassurance. I thought we were just messing around and didn't think too much about it. I leave his apartment and I'm waiting for my uber to arrive but before I leave the lobby I noticed I could no longer see him on my snapchat  friend's list. I then text him and asked him why he blocked me on snap chat but he also blocked my cell phone number. I was shocked because I genuinely believed him. He would talk about future plans with me and that's another reason why I thought things were okay. Anyways he led me on moments before blocking me off everything and I thought that was a shitty thing to do. I didn't mean to hurt him and I certainly would understand if he were no longer interested but I wasn't even worth an explanation. I've been feeling like shit the whole day and can't stop thinking he must've thought I was ugly and fat or simply didn't think we were compatible or maybe just maybe it was because of what I did to his dick.

Hey! First time doing this on Reddit. Not really a fan of Tinder and/or Bumble just because of the sheer superficiality of the exercise. Not ugly but I‚Äôm no Zayn Malik or Adam Levine either. 

I‚Äôm a 26 year old business owner managing two different kinds of businesses in Makati and in Manila. These were capital investments courtesy of my parents as a graduation gift and what kept me busy for 5 years.

I just came out of a long-term relationship a year ago and stopped dating entirely in order to shift my focus to myself after years of planning for ‚Äúus‚Äù. 

Now, after 7 years out of the dating scene. I have absolutely no idea how to bounce back and my friends introduced me to this kind of dating lol and it piqued my curiosity. Hence, why I am here.

I do not know what comes next after posting this, might not even attract any takers but hey, life‚Äôs too short for inhibitions and overthinking to stop you so, I guess PM me if you‚Äôre interested. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Have a great day!

TL:DR: I‚Äôm a 26 year old entrepreneur who‚Äôs not handsome and just came out of a long relationship now wants to get back to the dating game. PM me if that interests you.

He has a song called Natural and a song called I Don't Mind AND he uses the words dancing in the dark in a line in I Don't Mind

TLDR; Not enough Male eating disorder representation. Want to know if more media of it exists? TV, Movies, Books, etc.

...

So it is obvious male eating disorder representation is not always discussed nor shown in media. Sure, some celebrity males have opened up about eating disorders..Billy Bob Thornton, Dennis Quaid, Eminem, Zayn Malik, Joaquin Phoenix, Kit Harrington. Just to name a few, quite a lot more but too lazy to look up/name them all.

Television:

Dennis- It's always sunny in Philadelphia (USA)
...Brought up and mentioned in a few episodes, there is a YouTube video on it.

Jason Roscoe- Hollyoaks (British soap)
...Not horribly portrayed..it definitely evolved into a decent storyline for him.

Harry- Waterloo Road (British soap)
...This character was bulimic and it spanned a few episodes for his character.

Ringo- Neighbours (Australian soap)
...This one is a decent storyline that spans out and is not immediately addressed and "fixed" and he is even shown relapsing.

Seb- Home and Away (Austalian soap)
...I have seen a few snippets on YouTube and it seems this storyline does span out decently and is not just a "one and done".

Jimmy- The Real O'Neals (USA)
...Awful. It is literally one episode, mentioned then it is "cured" the next episode.

Toby- Degrassi the Next Generation (USA/CANADA teen soap)
...Decent writing, the character deals with an eating disorder but he only suffers for one episode.

Various characters (males)- Starved (USA)
...I LOVED this show when it came out but it received SO much backlash it did not last long.

Other Male characters to mention randomly:
Everwood (Male bulimic) (USA)
ER (Male bulimic) (USA)
House MD (Male anorexic) (USA)
Casualty (Male anorexic) (British soap)

Movies:

Luke from the Netflix film To the Bone.
Christian Bale's character from The Machinist.

There has to be more??

Books:

Target,
The art of starving,
The incredible Jake Parker,
Broken Glass,
Nothing,
Starved,
Skin and Bones,
Straw Man,
A Trick of the Light 

...

Am I missing any? Can anyone else contribute?

TLDR; Not enough Male eating disorder representation. Want to know if more media of it exists? TV, Movies, Books, etc.

1. I am grateful for Borat. For me his old material from the U.K. and USA for the Ali G TV series is timeless. It cracks me up so much. Literally the funniest stuff I have seen (along with Paul Chowdhury‚Äôs YouTube videos about Zayn Malik which also crack me up). I can always come back to these videos and get a laugh. Literally seen all of the Borat stuff many times over but I still love it. One of my favourites is ‚ÄúBorat goes to acting school‚Äù on YouTube.

2. I am grateful for my electric guitar. I really wanted to play my acoustic guitar at around 1am but didn‚Äôt want to annoy the neighbours and then remembered I could just play my electric unplugged. Was cool just to play for a bit and made progress on the song I‚Äôm writing.

3. I am grateful for my sister who I visited yesterday. I would say after my mum who is no longer here, she is the one who gets me the most. She‚Äôs really intelligent and gives good advice and is a really good listener too when we have a quiet moment. I used to love watching films with her and also having late night chats with her over the last few years. One of my favourite times was one weekend where we sat talking for hours and also watched Arrival.

4. I am grateful for the view outside my window.
I get to watch squirrels and look at huge trees. It‚Äôs a rarity to have a view of a garden in the area where I live, so I‚Äôm pretty thankful to have a serene view outside my windowZ

5. I am grateful for the ability to walk. It blows my mind that tiny electric sparks from my brain cascade along neurones and down my spine to create movement. It blows my mind. Sometimes I‚Äôm walking around and think wow it‚Äôs such a delicate and intricate process and allows me to move my legs and get around. The spine is so complex full of all sorts of ‚Äúwiring‚Äù to aid walking. It‚Äôs a beautiful process.

6. I am grateful for showers. I love the feeling of the water hitting my skin. All these thousands of droplets hitting my skin give a sensory experience that helps wake me up daily. No matter how many showers I have I will never tire of that feeling of having one. It‚Äôs rejuvenating.

7. I am grateful for the park near my house. I love to sit there and journal / read a book / hang with a friend. It‚Äôs a pleasant place. People come  there to have a chat and others come to play chess there.

8. I am grateful for chess. I only recently started to learn to play. I love the strategy involved and I love the fact that 64 squares and 32 pieces can bring about 16 million possible/different games. That blows my mind. If a game with 64 squares has this many possibilities, then something as dynamic as the life/world we live in has an endless ocean of opportunities. Infinite possibilities. That is a beautiful thing. Endless endless opportunities. It is awe inspiring and exciting.

9. I am grateful for my holiday in Budapest. That was such a cool trip going as a group of four. It was freezing cold, but we had so much fun out there. The apartment we stayed in was really classy. So beautifully decorated and the place was solid. I would actually love to own property out there. Such a solid building. You could jump around like a mad man and no one could learn you in the floor below because the stone soaked up all the sound and vibration. We had fun going out too to one of the clubs there. Was really cool. Ate some good food. Even went to the opera which was an experience. Til this day we quote lines from that in operatic voices just for jokes. One line in particular always get a laugh. Great times.

10. I am grateful for one of my friends, N, who I studied with. This guy is so funny. He‚Äôs a bit more serious these days but the man has the ability to crack me up. Some of the quips he comes up with would make my stomach hurt cos I‚Äôd laugh so much. He‚Äôs a really good guy and is a very caring genuine person too.
jesus fucking Christ i don‚Äôt care about harry stylus or Liam windowpane just fucking shut up

we‚Äôre all in a group chat together, typical friend stuff, and this one girl will not shut up about her wanting to jerk off zayn malik or whatever.

If you know the story of Icarus falls - you know the story of how he flew too close to the sun, and that caused his fall.

There's a certain amount of sadness in this story, and I tried to depict this sadness with the sadness in the cover of 'Sign Of The Times' to show 'post-1D' life for Harry and Zayn.

I've never really told this to anyone and I wanted to get it off my chest for a while so here you go.

I'm from a Muslim family and I was so homophobic growing up and never thought I was gay in any way although I questioned it a lot and said "am I gay??" a lot. Only to say naaah of course not.

I'd question it whenever I was thinking about how I'm more sensitive/emotionally intelligent generally than the guys around me and I'd find it hard to click with them because I'm not laddy at all and also how I seem to only be able to make friends with girls (who would also think I was gay because of their gaydars until I actually spoke about girls I liked)

I would think guys were kinda hot but then turn my nose up at the idea of being gay with them because its unnatural and wrong and disgusting and all the other random shit shoved down my throat through childhood. I always assumed that if you were gay you'd just want to fuck every male around so I would never think of hanging out with a gay person in case they hit on me - i was never presented with the comparison between opposite gender heterosexuals being just friends and not being attracted to every single girl around to debunk that and I now get it cause I only give guys a double take in the street if I actually think they're attractive and my type rather than just being male.

It was only in my first year of uni when I was listening to Zayn Malik and imagining being with him I was literally like yo. I would genuinely kiss him he's so hot i love his beard and his face I just wanna make out with him. I considered the possibilities further and said yeah sure I'd suck a dick willingly (in the past when asked by my guy friends if I'd suck dick for ¬£1m I took a moment and then said yeah sure cause it's so much money why not just do it the one time? - they a said that they wouldn't even do that which just felt confusing to me but I ignored it thinking in still straight).

Yeah anyway a long time after that with my bi brain "activated" where I didn't think I was just straight anymore, I went about my life but still felt conflicted as I'd never had a real life male crush and I'd never actually been attracted to a man before, only imagined it and not been put off or turned off by it. So I did what any logical 18 year old would do, I watched gay p0rn to see if I liked it üòÇ I'll be honest the idea of getting fucked turned me on so i sort of settled with it though i was very very picky of what type of guys i thought were attractive and worth watching (whereas with girls basically all p0rnstars will get me off).

Anyway, has anyone had a similar experience? Did you know you were bi your entire life or did it kind of awaken when you were older?

Also how do I know I'm actually bi? Like what if i am actually straight and it's just a phase where I'm telling myself I'm also gay and I'll eventually grow up and think "what was i thinking" cause my close friend who's Muslim seems to think that and i spent the majority of my life pretty convinced i was straight and hated gay people so what if I'm just telling myself I'm bi? How do I legit know?
Most of the replies to the [Euphoria twitter account] (https://twitter.com/euphoriaHBO/status/1145772355882561536) are extremely negative, since it seems as if neither Harry Styles or Louis Tomlinson approved of the animated scene from Ep 3. What do you think, should it have been approved? Is it fine? 

Personally, I see how Louis could be a bit angry, given this [tweet] (https://twitter.com/Louis_Tomlinson/status/1145753419447177218). However, it was just fanfiction and it's portrayal in an animated style. Take the novel/movie After, which was based on a Harry Styles and Zayn Malik fanfiction (although this example is much calmer).



  

I‚Äôve never understood why girls (and some guys) go gaga over these two I just can‚Äôt see anything attractive about them. Yes, they dress nice and style themselves in a nice way, but they simply aren‚Äôt attractive enough to be rated 9‚Äôs and 10‚Äôs consistently. Real attractiveness belongs to men like Henry Cavill, Rob Evans, Zac Efron, Ian Somerhalder, Zayn Malik etc.

Typical Features of male attractiveness include:

Browner Skin

Narrower Facial Shape Less Fat

Darker Eyebrows

More and Darker lashes

Higher Cheekbones

More prominent chin

Thinner lids

No wrinkles between nose and corner of mouth

Height 

Muscularity

Leonardo DiCaprio has nice tan skin, roundish (chubby) face, darker brows, regular lashes, no visible cheekbones due to roundish face, a recessed chin, wrinkles, a dad bod and above average (not extraordinary height of 5‚Äô11‚Äô‚Äô).

Similarly, Brad Pitt has nice tanned skin, a rounded face with limited protrusion of jawline and check bones, dark brows, wrinkles, a dad bod and as like DiCaprio a not particularly impressive height of 5‚Äô11‚Äô‚Äô.

Taking into consideration both their attractive and unattractive features this would rate them about a 7-8/10 max not a 9-10/10 as they are commonly rated by people. 

Now let‚Äôs compare this to a rightly so attractive male, in Henry Cavill.

Henry Cavill‚Äôs height is 6‚Äô1‚Äô‚Äô way above the male average of 5‚Äô9‚Äô‚Äô (In the US), making him stand out more, Henry also has a fairly muscular body and a slight mix of dad bod in the stomach however the muscularity is clear through the arms and chest without a doubt (highly attractive). His brows are also thick, and protrusion of a strong jawline, high cheekbones and brow ridge are clearly visible. His has slight wrinkles in his face however, he appears to be one of those males whose looks improve with age unlike DiCaprio and Pitt. Combined these features make him a clear 10/10 or high 9.

Now I understand attractiveness is not purely facial but to keep saying that they are 10/10 in attractiveness when other men much more attractive than them exists does not make sense to me.

 Feel free to prove me wrong and share your opinions.

This natural malediction that touches old and young men alike üë¥

For an extreme case, look at this guy who goes from a 4 to an 8 just thanks to hair [Baldness ](https://www.instagram.com/phildoeshair/p/BvG73xrlCmW/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=ebb8l0id7gb5) 

There is natural and early onset baldness. I think I have natural (Basically your hairline recedes a bit on both sides of the forehead) but it's still affecting my look. 

I have short hair so I can't really hide it that much. 

Some men are graced with a hairline that never recedes like Zayn Malik and Nick Jonas (his brother, however, has baldness and god damn it shows when you see them together)

So what do you make of this? Is this making you insecure? 
The scene opens back up to Angie Apathy inspecting the disastrous scene on the mainstage. She looks down at the debris and shakes her head and sighs as she rolls Sir‚Äôs stripper pole back with her foot, revealing a damaged runway floor. She signals to Tish and Anita that the lipsync can‚Äôt possibly go forward because this is a family friendly show and not 1,000 Ways to Die.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúDel O‚ÄôRyan. Amelia Velvet. It seems as if the universe does not want us to part just yet. You are both safe. The lipsync is canceled,‚Äù says Tish who is secretly fuming because all the good lipsync songs such as ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go Crazy‚Äù (fuck you Diana xoxo), ‚ÄúSquare Biz‚Äù and now ‚ÄúMisery Business‚Äù were compromised. But whatevs, life goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

**WILLOW: GAG! This is totally crazy. Who could have expected this? Did you? Certainly not I.**

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúYou may join the other girls,‚Äù Anita says.

As Del and Amelia carefully step over the hazardous scene and make their way to the back, the structure that was holding Sir‚Äôs stripper pole to the ceiling falls onto the end of the runway right where the girls were standing just a moment prior, forming a large crater. Tish and Anita look at each other for a brief moment with a bead of sweat dripping down their foreheads.

&amp;#x200B;

**AMELIA: Only 3.5 seconds separated me and my lawyer from suing Tish and Anita for all their money and their crowns‚Ä¶ Anybody got a time machine?**

&amp;#x200B;

Tish and Anita begin to speak in unison, ‚ÄúRemember if you can‚Äôt love yourself how in the hell can you love somebody else, can I get an amen up in here?!‚Äù

‚ÄúAmen!‚Äù

‚ÄúNow let the music play!‚Äù

The queens shimmy in place to some song by Brandy because it‚Äôs Tish‚Äôs episode. They don‚Äôt dare to venture down the runway that‚Äôs now in shambles. Smart move queenies.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The queens strut their stuff back into the workroom after judging. Despite the fact that no queen was eliminated, there is a lipstick message on the board.

&amp;#x200B;

Del walks up to the mirror and recites the message.

‚ÄúKeep your eyes open, girly girls. Keep your ears pricked. Keep looking behind you. Because one day I'll find you, and then you'll be squirrel food.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The girls let out a gasp.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?!‚Äù Portia exclaims. ‚ÄúI came here to win a fake drag competition not get turned into an acorn. Who is behind this???‚Äù She begins to swivel her body to scan the room.

&amp;#x200B;

**ELLE: First hydrogen peroxide-gate and now this? Why am I always getting threatened by fake drag queens?**

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúRelax, it‚Äôs just Tish and Anita fucking with us. They love a good twist,‚Äù Amelia says in an attempt to reassure everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúYeah, I suppose you‚Äôre ri-‚Äù Del says with a slight hesitation before getting interrupted by the mirror dislodging from the wall and falling to the floor, shattering into a million pieces.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúAAAAHHHH!!‚Äù The girls scream, startled as can be. They look at eachother with wide eyes, worried about what might happen next. The scene fades out‚Ä¶.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Grainy footage of the werkroom‚Äôs entrance is displayed on the screen with a timestamp at the bottom labeled 4:06 AM. The werkroom is pitch black and the footage displayed is captured through an infrared lens. Long slender fingers with nails painted an onyx black appear at the doorframe, caressing it seductively. Some sort of cloaked figure holding a black box creeps into view and slowly makes its way down the walkway, its white eyes gleaming. The footage glitches and shows the figure leaving the werkroom, the black box no longer in its hands.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, the girls enter the werkroom. There‚Äôs a strange air in the room. The usual background music is not playing and the lightbulbs are just a tad bit duller than usual. The sounds of the girl‚Äôs footsteps and breathing is the sole soundtrack to the scene.

&amp;#x200B;

**PORTIA: Okay so I really have to fart but it‚Äôs really quiet in here. Maybe I‚Äôll just let it out little by little and hope for the best.**

&amp;#x200B;

The girls stare at each other at the lounge area, not saying a word. Portia makes a guilty face, looking cautiously at each girl as a high pitched noise sounds.

‚ÄúDid you girls hear that?‚Äù Elle says with a puzzled expression on her face.

‚ÄúOh sorry that was my- Nevermind,‚Äù says Portia.

‚ÄúNo really girls, do you hear that? That thumping noise‚Ä¶‚Äù Elle continues.

Come to think of it, if you listened closely, you could hear the faint sound of *something* pounding like a metronome very faintly.

&amp;#x200B;

The girls stand up and begin to follow the sound, with Elle leading them. The lights begin to flicker like a strobe light, making their movements look like still images. With every step they take, the sound seems to get louder and louder. They make their way to the southeast corner of the room, where Tooth‚Äôs station used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúHas that black box always been there?‚Äù Amelia says with a tremble in her voice.

&amp;#x200B;

Del, clearly the brave one, nods her head at her sisters indicating that she will open the box. She creeps forward slowly, her breathing turns into panting and beads of sweat trickle down her forehead, hanging off the tip of her nose. With one big step, Del positions herself in front of the black box. She holds her hand above it, gathering her energy to lift the lid. The sound of the pounding at its absolute loudest.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúFucking do it Delanie,‚Äù Amelia says, encouraging her sister.

&amp;#x200B;

Del quickly lifts the lid and chucks it behind her as she flinches, covering her face in her knees. The girls take a step back frightened. Del turns her head, peaking with one eye when she realizes that nothing came out of the box. She stands up and peeks in. She shrieks.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS A FUCKING HEART!‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The lights turn off.

&amp;#x200B;

The girls run across the room to the doorway and run into a metal fence, the metal rattling as they fall down in front of it. They‚Äôve been barricaded inside.

&amp;#x200B;

A deep demonic voice begins to play from the loudspeaker.

&amp;#x200B;

"Hello my girls... I've been watching you all for the longest time.... I wanted to give you my heart, but I realized if I did I couldn't get to see the smiles on your faces. So I gave you someone else's...."

&amp;#x200B;

The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer in the doorway put the girls on edge, their bodies tense. The girls hold on to each-other for dear life, except for Portia who runs away, banging into every possible object in her path. As soon as the steps seem to be right near where they are located, they stop. Silence.

&amp;#x200B;

The room is so quiet that the girls can hear the blood rushing in their brains. One. Two. Three. BAAAAAAMMMM!! The fence rattles loudly as if it got hit by a blunt metal object. They all jump and scream their heads off.

&amp;#x200B;

The lights turn back on, and this time the lights are as bright and cheerful as ever. Even the fun background music we all know and love comes back. Despite this, the horrified faces of the girls are still plastered on their faces. Willow literally peed herself.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúHEY HEY HEY!‚Äù The hosts Tish and Anita exclaim as they bust through their door wearing all black suits with tiffany blue accents and walk over to address the girls about their next challenge.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúLadies, don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôre not going to die. At least, not today‚Ä¶. For this week‚Äôs main challenge you will be paying homage to the world of horror cinematography‚Ä¶..‚Äù Tish says.

‚Äú....In our seasons makeover challenge!‚Äù Anita says excitedly.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. You will be tasked with completing four separate looks for two categories. The first category is **Final Girl and Monster Realness.** For this category you will create a look for yourself that screams ‚Äúfinal girl‚Äù, which is a trope in horror films that refers to the last woman alive to confront the killer. You will create a look for your makeover partner that paints them as a horror movie ‚Äúmonster‚Äù, which is completely open to your own interpretation. This category will presented as a floorshow, which means that it‚Äôs more descriptive and detailed than a runway. It should tell a story through actions with no or minimal dialogue. You will also design your own set for this category. The second category is **It Came From the Black Lagoon**. For this category you will create two fashion forward and *avant garde* looks for you and your partner that are *inspired* by (a) horror movie(s) of your choice. This category will be presented on the mainstage and will be your lipsync look.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúAnd you won‚Äôt believe who you‚Äôll be making over‚Ä¶.‚Äù Tish says with a smirk.

&amp;#x200B;

All of a sudden, the five former members of the English boy band One Direction bust through the door: Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson. The boys stand in a line across from the girls and the hook of "What Makes You Beautiful" plays as background music.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúAlright boys, you will be choosing which queen you want to work with. A randomizer has decided what order you will choose in.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The boys pick in the order of Harry, Louis, Zayn, Niall and Liam.

&amp;#x200B;

The pairs are as follows:

Harry - Del

Louis - Willow

Zayn - Amelia

Niall - Portia

Liam - Elle

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúGentlemen, start your engines and may the best woman WIN!‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

I was born in ‚Äò05 and my real name (no I‚Äôm not lying) is Zayn Malik. Been spelled like that since birth. AMA?



Since I haven‚Äôt gotten any takers. Trying to repost. Sorry in advance if this is not allowed lol

REPOST: Hey! First time doing this on Reddit. Not really a fan of Tinder and/or Bumble just because of the sheer superficiality of the exercise. Not ugly but I‚Äôm no Zayn Malik or Adam Levine either. 

I‚Äôm a 26 year old business owner managing two different kinds of businesses in Makati and in Manila. These were capital investments courtesy of my parents as a graduation gift and what kept me busy for 5 years. 5‚Äô8‚Äù in height. Medium-built that occasionally goes to the gym.

I just came out of a long-term relationship a year ago and stopped dating entirely in order to shift my focus to myself after years of planning for ‚Äúus‚Äù. 

Now, after 7 years out of the dating scene. I have absolutely no idea how to bounce back and my friends introduced me to this kind of dating lol and it piqued my curiosity. Hence, why I am here.

I do not have a preference per-se. As much as possible I would like to talk to those in the Metro Manila area as well. And a great conversationalist is a plus.

I do not know what comes next after posting this, might not even attract any takers but hey, life‚Äôs too short for inhibitions and overthinking to stop you so, I guess PM me if you‚Äôre interested. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Have a great day!

TL:DR: I‚Äôm a 26 year old entrepreneur who‚Äôs not handsome and just came out of a long relationship now wants to get back to the dating game. PM me if that interests you.
I am not hot as Chris Evans, Zayn Malik or any other male model with long eyelashes. It just make me even more feminine than I already am. It really bothers me but it is also a way to protect my eyes. Should I shave it or trim it anyway to appear more masculine? Thanks.

I boycott a few wmaf businesses near me, and doscourage my friends from goong there.
Sorry, I just don't have the time to find out if their wmaf is non-racist because in most cases, they are. I had the unfortunate experience of going to an asian noodle place without realizing owners were wmaf, and out came the creepy old white owner ... hovering around my asian female friends ... and telling us of his travels to East Asia, and lecturing us on his knowledge of SE Asia. I had to tell him to leave us alone.
And in op's case (if not troll), he has a right because she isn't just an innocent af in wmaf, her porfolio reveals white supremacist tendencies.

&gt;Most of India(north and south) and all of Pakistan are genetically much closer to Europeans. In fact, they share a lot of haplogroups with middle easterners especially Iranians. Many Indians are indo-Iranians.
In fact, if you take half white half Indian kids, they don‚Äôt look mixed/hapa. They look south European.

In fact, until the 1970s Indians were considered white in America. 
Even the dravidiens of India came down to India from Iran. Their ancestors were Neolithic Iranian farmers.
However, they‚Äôre grouped together as the same race as Asian in America. Why?

Question. Why so many black guys on this sub, yet there are no Asian guys on black subs, like blackfellas? The vast majority of black users here pretend to have good intentions, but, if challenged, will just gaslight and outright lie, trying to claim blacks are like some perfect saints, trying to absolve them of all responsibility. Yet, you'd lose your shit if whites tried to downplay white racism towards blacks.

Dude, BTS only dance. They are taken during their youth into training camps to be manufactured as an entertainment product.
That's the whole point of idol bands descended from Kitagawa formula.
And their face are specifically chosen in a way which cause this kind of phenomenon. How can you possibly say this is pro-asian when it encourages dudes to remove the very things that define them as Asian from their face?
Solid explanation from DeWesternized here:

So, Liam Gallagher is my favorite vocalist and the most integral component of oasis is his voice IMO, anyways, how does he compare to some Modern Day singers such as Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Chester Bennington, Dan Reynolds and chris cornell(who one of my friends said was better than liam but i vehemently defended liam)
In honor of Harry doing double duty on SNL this weekend, and all of the members (including Zayn) planning on releasing new music in the upcoming weeks/months, I decided to spend this weekend listening to One Direction‚Äôs discography in full for the first time (I've only ever heard their singles) and share my thoughts with all of you. While I originally planned on just listening to the music, I ended up taking a crash course in all things 1D. That means watching a 90-minute video of their X-Factor journey, This is Us, countless interviews, and, yes, trying to wrap my head around Larry Stylinson and Babygate. Without further ado, here we go:

Up All Night: This is classic ‚Äúreality show contestants need to put together something ASAP.‚Äù Up All Night is mostly filler buoyed by the genuinely exuberant ‚ÄúWhat Makes You Beautiful‚Äù along with a handful of other fun tracks. As the first major boyband in almost a decade, One Direction (or rather, at this point in their career, Simon Cowell), had to figure out how they fit into the music world of 2011. The boys were given a collection of songs spanning pop-rock, R&amp;B-lite, and AC ballads. Something that genuinely surprised me was just how much of this album was edm-pop, considering they‚Äôre largely associated with pop-rock and power-pop. However, it makes sense, as dance music was the sound of 2011. However, WMYB ended up being the big hit, and that was the musical path they decided to continue on for their following albums (let‚Äôs just all be happy that Stole My Heart wasn‚Äôt their breakout song). Liam‚Äôs voice fits this music the best out of everyone, although Zayn and Harry have the best overall voices. Conversely, Niall sounds the most processed (although he and Louis barely sings solos). However, listening to this also makes you realize that, at this point, none of the members had the presence or direction (no pun intended) to carry an album on their own; there isn‚Äôt a singular talent on this record that makes you take notice the way that other young, solo artists of the time (Miley, Justin, etc.) managed to do. This is further exemplified by the fact that the three songs the members are credited on (Taken, Everything About You, and Same Mistakes), are some of the worst songs on the record. It was going to take some time for them to grow and develop as artists.

Best Song: What Makes You Beautiful

Worst Song: Gotta be You

Standard Rating:¬†5.78

Rating with bonus tracks: 5.54

Take Me Home: A year later and the boys are back! This album shows a marked improvement over their debut, with the band and their collaborators (many returning from their last album) beginning to hone their craft and focusing on the guitar-driven pop which proved to be the sound that resonated most with their core audience as well as the general public. While much more consistent than Up All Night, Take Me Home still manages to contain plenty of filler. Probably the best quality of this album is the improvement of the vocals. There is a sense of assuredness and control to their voices that was not nearly as consistent on their debut. Additionally, the songs they contributed to this time around (Last First Kiss, Back for You, Summer Love, and bonus track Still the One) show great leaps in their writing; none of the songs are amazing, but they show a stronger point of view and ear for melody than before. Overall, a solid album that shows they are capable of growth.

Midnight Memories: This is clearly a transitional album; even the artwork looks like a cross between UAN/TMH and Four/MITAM. The year of this album was also the year that This is Us, a documentary/concert film starring the band, was released. While it showed plenty of light-hearted, fun moments, it also gave a glimpse into how different their world was from the average person. They were consistently indoors, kept in business offices, hotels, or venues with only each other and their team for company. When they did have the opportunity to explore, they were constantly accosted by fans and paparazzi. All of this is to say that the band traded a key period of development for young people (late teens/early 20‚Äôs) to be the biggest pop group in the world, and while I don‚Äôt think any of them would give it back, it had to have affected them. At this point the band clearly wanted to move away from the clean-cut, preppy teen image they were presented with early in their career. Trading in their J. Crew for tattoos, they were figuring out who they wanted to be, both as people and artists.¬† By now their collaborators had largely been streamlined to a consistent group that gave them a clear, distinct sonic identity. Leaning into the ‚Äúrock‚Äù side of pop-rock, it seems they wanted this be their ‚Äúwe‚Äôre young adults now‚Äù album. However, their attempts at maturity largely fall flat, with the exception being ‚ÄúStory of My Life.‚Äù The rest of the standout tracks are the upbeat, poppy numbers, with Tomlinson having a writing credit on the best non-single (Stronger).

Four: This album feels like a huge jump in quality, and is also the first album where I didn‚Äôt outright hate any song (on the standard edition). On Four, it seems like the band figured out what worked and what didn‚Äôt last time, as well as continuing the growth of their songwriting. Whereas Midnight Memories felt like someone making music that they thought was grown-up, Four feels like someone making music that genuinely reflects their experiences. Also, their last album felt like they were focused on how they were being perceived, whereas this album feels like, while they‚Äôre aware of their audience and want people to listen to them, they don‚Äôt feel self-conscious about the opinions of their listeners and will make music that feels right for them. While Liam, Zayn, and Harry still sing most of the solos, Louis and Niall still have their moments (although they continually give Niall the worst songs‚Ä¶Act My Age? Really?). While their music always sounded contemporary, this is the first album that feels like it‚Äôs in tune with what was popular at the time. Still leaning towards pop-rock, the album had touches of 80‚Äôs pop (Steal My Girl) and folk-pop (Fireproof). Some of the album tracks lack memorable choruses, but overall this is an engaging listen. While they still have a good dynamic as a group, it also feels like you could hear the potential of the members as solo artists, such as when they take turns serenading on ‚ÄúNight Changes‚Äù, or when Styles steals the show on ‚ÄúStockholm Syndrome‚Äù.

Made in the AM: Most boybands don‚Äôt make it to five albums, nor are they able to close out with their best work. However, One Direction manages to accomplish both with Made in the AM. Written and recorded in the aftermath of Zayn Malik‚Äôs departure, a lackluster, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just finish this‚Äù attitude could have resulted in a lesser album. However, the boys decided to go out with a bang, and release their most consistent and mature work. The first two singles, ‚ÄúDrag Me Down‚Äù and ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù are both big pop records, with guitars added to give a punchy quality to overall sonic landscape, as opposed to defining the sound. While great songs, they are outliers to the rest of the album, which is a collection of ideas you wouldn‚Äôt associate with a boy band seemingly on their last legs. ‚ÄúHey Angel‚Äù is indebted to Brit-pop, and ‚ÄúIf I Could Fly‚Äù is a genuinely striking piece of piano balladry, which demonstrates huge strides in Harry‚Äôs songwriting. ‚ÄúNever Enough‚Äù and ‚ÄúOlivia‚Äù are two unexpected bursts of pure joy late in the tracklist; it‚Äôs great to see One Direction still trying out new sounds at this stage in their career when they could just phone it in. ‚ÄúWhat A Feeling‚Äù is their most straight-forward Fleetwood Mac tribute that they still manage to make their own. The best part of this album overall is that the band members feel grown-up, like real young adults, ready to explore whatever‚Äôs going to come next, and that everyone brings something to the table. A group that was put together because the individuals couldn‚Äôt stand on their own eventually became a group of artists choosing to come together to make a cohesive and creative body of work.

So, what did I learn from my 1D binge? Apparently it‚Äôs possible to become a stan over the course of a single weekend (and also now regret missing the fandom when the band was actually together‚Ä¶but I‚Äôll be here when they go on their inevitable reunion tour!). I always assumed groups like this were primarily filler, and while that was definitely the case with their early albums, these guys had a genuine vision they wanted to achieve with their work, and ended up making some pretty great music.


**Stand Name:** „ÄåTWISTED MIND O' MINE„Äç

**Namesake:** Mind of Mine album by Zayn Malik

**Stand Type:** Close Range Artificial Humanoid

**Appearance:** „ÄåTWISTED MIND O' MINE„Äçor TMOM for short, can be described as a hypnotic demon due to it's blinding, ever-changing rainbow colour scheme resembling a bright spiral of colours and its devil-like appearance. It has 3 separate horns protruding from its forehead all twisting in different directions with the middle being the longest. Just below that, being the only other feature on the stands face, it has two great big sockets for eyes that glow a bright fluorescent pink. In place of traditional hands and feet TMOM has sharp jagged claws with spear-like protrusions sticking out the the back of each heel and 5 smaller protrusions sticking out the back of each knuckle (one for each finger). While the stands hands and feet are rough and intimidating the actual body, head, arms, and legs of the stand are all smooth and slender helping lead people into a false sense of security.

**Speed: C**

**Range: (Physical) E, ("PARTY TIME") B**

**Stand User:** Klaus Godstoff, an escapee from a mental asylum who was constantly placed in isolation due to his obsessive desire to mentally torture people to the point where some would be driven to join in his insanity. Klaus' long wavy but also chaotic hair has been turned white from years of stress and his eyes are constantly bloodshot with a crazed look in them. He developed „ÄåTWISTED MIND O' MINE„Äçwhile on the run when he was cut on the foot by a "mysterious gold fragment" :)

**Stand Ability:** „ÄåTWISTED MIND O' MINE„Äçhas 2 abilities, the first of which being "MIND TUMBLE". Whenever someone looks directly into this stands eyes (including the user) the world will appear to warp itself into unnatural forms causing the witness to lose all sense of direction as well as control over their body. If the witness' mind/will is not strong enough either, they may also enter into a brutal state of convulsions that may result in death. The ability is impossible to forcefully cancel but will luckily disappear by itself after 1 minute.

TMOM's second ability which also makes it eligible for this contest is called "PARTY TIME". PARTY TIME has a MASSIVE cooldown of 10 minutes and rightfully so. When activated, ALL stands (yes this includes TMOM) within a 20 meter radius are thrust into new bodies similar to SCR. Unlike SCR however it is not a direct swap and there is a chance that you may have your stand given to another person but no ones stand ends up in you so you become "standless". The new users gain all previous knowledge about the stand that was known by its previous user including how to use it with no time delay so a fight can begin at any moment making the 10 minute cooldown feel extra long. Even if TMOM is destroyed the effects of PARTY TIME will not be undone, the only way to reverse the effects is to reuse PARTY TIME once the cooldown is over and hope all stands go back to their original owners, but there is no guarantee.

If I win I'd like the next theme to be sentient stand (ex. GER and SCR, not just it's own personality like Echos or Spice Girl)

Ive been reading lots of posts in this sub though i have no idea which product to get since there are so many.
I have really fine hair but not thin at all its really dense. Right now im using got2b matte paste and i must say that im not unhappy with it but im sure There are many better products out There.

What im looking for is a product which i can use for a messy quiff like justin Bieber or Zayn malik once had and a really matte finish i dont know about the hold but id like to run through my hair without really having any product in my hands afterwards throughout the day

From what ive read so far should be the best are:

Blumaan monarch: ive read so many comments that this isnt really a matte finish so i dont know if i really want to try it

Northern light: i have 0 Information about it just heard it alot and im not sure

Arcadian matte paste: i feel like this should be the one im looking for but idk if its that great for a messy quiff

If im wrong with anything feel free to tell me im really unsure what to get but i feel like all 3 should outperform got2b beach matte i guess?

Really open for any prestyler recommendations as well!



Twitter falsely accused me of impersonation. They think my fan account was impersonating Zayn Malik because I had posted pics of him and One Direction and he was my icon and One Direction was my banner. I wasn't impersonating Zayn or anyone because I had posted pics of myself and I put my real name associated with the account. Twitter is taking down fan accounts that have a famous figure as their icon and or banner. I get that there are some fan accounts that are trying to impersonate someone famous. But not every fan account is trying to do that. I have tried to get my account back several times and How can I get my Twitter account back when Twitter falsely accused me of impersonation? Why is Twitter attacking fan accounts and falsely accusing them of impersonation when the fan accounts are not aiming to impersonate someone? Why doesn't Twitter believe that some fan accounts are not impersonating someone? Why is Twitter taking down fan accounts that are not impersonating someone famous?
I really like Zayn Malik‚Äôs 2014 longer hairstyle. I really want it but I‚Äôm an Asian and I feel like it‚Äôll be impossible.

My hair is currently looking like this: https://imgur.com/gallery/p0YsJr5

I want my hair to look like this: https://imgur.com/gallery/4zoGNvH (minus the mullet in the back)

Is this possible for me? How long will it take? What are the measurements that I should shoot for in the front and sides?

Zayn Malik has a message for Gigi Hadid haters, and it's loud and clear.

"My tweet was not about @GigiHadid¬†so leave her the f--k alone," the former One Direction band member writes on¬†Twitter. "She is the most amazing woman I've ever known."

He continues, "And \[she\] does nothing but love and support me when lord knows I don't deserve it." The 26-year-old star blasts Hadid's haters even more by¬†saying, "If you know nothing shut your f--king mouth."

Noted!

For those not following the "Like I Would" singer on social media, he shared a cryptic tweet on April 3¬†that raised many eyebrows.

"How about you all go f--k yourselves with your irrelevant bulls--t," he captioned his post. Naturally, many assumed Malik was talking about the 23-year-old supermodel. Especially after several publications reported Hadid was allegedly dating Selena Gomez's ex-boyfriend, Samuel Krost.

However, the fashion model was quick to shut down those rumors.

"If you outlets are going to continue writing bs headlines every time I'm seen with a friend of the male gender then there's gunna \[sic\] be a lot of unneeded confusion," she tweeted on April 3.

More recently, the two sparked¬†romance speculation¬†after the 26-year-old singer tweeted, "@GigiHadid love you."

Despite his affection towards the fashion model this year, he still doesn't follow her on Instagram. In fact, he unfollowed her and Yolanda Hadid¬†last March, after the two called it quits. It didn't take long before the two picked things up and by the late fall, many began to think they split up for good.

Back in January, a source told E! News¬†the 23-year-old supermodel and Malik¬†"have been spending \[time\] apart since early November." At the time, the insider revealed they both "think it's best for the sake of the relationship right now."

Fans of the stars know they've been on-again, off-again, however, they've always kept thing cordial.

In the words of Zayn, "This ain't a place for feelings."

My cavalier clay I ordered is arriving today! I'm also getting my hair cut on Tuesday like the Zayn Malik haircut

Gusto ko lang sana ma-experience, kung up ka inbox mo ko. Rizal/Pasig area. Medyo picky lang ako gusto ko sana maganda o chinita ang first ko. Lol

I really don't like how I look at all. My confidence is always so low and I feel like i need to do something about it. I don't currently have the money to get any procedures done but would like to know what I can do, if anything, to improve my appearance. I really want to have that natural look of celebrities like Keanu Reeves, Chris Pratt, and Chris Evans.

https://imgur.com/a/NhTZpIm The one in the middle is what I look like now. What I know so far is that my nose is long and wide (im thinking rhinoplasty). My bottom lip looks droopy. My face is long as well and looks uneven because of my skull shape (i think skull augmentation would help). And I don't know what's happening with my eyes (you can't see because of the blue but they look so lazy)...

In this picture, it compares me with Zayn Malik and Keanu Reeves when they were the same age as me. I like their buzz-cut looks a lot and would want to look a little more like them but I just look a lot weirder.

Hey, I am a 20 year old male. I am really conscious about my pitted acne scars (not the red marks, there are some red marks though). I look kind of like Zayn Malik and I am a good singer as well but THE SCARS are a big disappointment. People have complimented me so many times calling me a handsome hunk. Mostly my cheeks have those scars. So, does it matter to you? be honest because fake hope is deadlier than fake people. üòèüòè TL;DR: Can acne scars make good looking people ugly?

Hey everyone,

I really like singing and have been singing for about 2 years, I'm 16 years old. However I'm not sure whether my voice is powerful enough to sound good and worth listening.I've attached a voice clip of me singing a verse of Zayn Malik from One-Direction's song More than this.Can you guys please tell if it's good or bad or maybe even worth listening?

Hey guys I wanted to have Zayn Malik‚Äôs beard and I notice he had poor growth during his late teens early adult life and WALAAA! Out of nowhere he started to build connectors and now he has a full grown beard. Luck much? Maybe it could be genetics but I doubt it considering he had a weak beard to start off with. Maybe he has a minoxidil coach that suggested he took it (Hollywood hacks) to get a thicker, fuller beard. Either way he has a sick beard and I was thinking that...

If I took minoxidil will I have a beard like him? I kinda do look like him even if I‚Äôm not Indian lol 
I guess Gigi finally 'Hadid'

 4 Ibn al-Sabbagh al-Maliki said: (Ja'far al-Sadiq (peace be upon him) was among his brothers, the successor of his father, and his guardian, and the imam after him, emerged on the group thanks, and was alerted by a male, and for them a fate ...) (10).

zayn malik for example

dude must've had the perfect diet growing up yet genetics still fucked him over with height
Hello all! So I've been wanting to make a post here for a while but kept putting off because I was always nervous about being judged about my voice and I still am, but I realized if I really want to move forward and grow I need to hear criticism and feedback anything that can hlp boost my progress.  
I joined my school choir back in 2017 and that's when I really started getting into singing gradually.. I'm a bass singer and my vocal range is D2-A5, so that's just a bit of background so I'll get into the meaty gritty of this post.  


When I got into singing my main goal was to be able to sing Pop and R&amp;B songs flawlessly like the likes of Chris Brown, Michael Jackson, Khalid, Justin Beiber, Zayn Malik etc.. but I quickly found out that my vocal type would be a slight hinderence due to the comfort range of my voice being a bass and not a tenor which is the usual range for most Pop songs out there.  


I've sang in front of people and on Instagram before, and people seem to "like" my voice and I get compliments some times but when I play it back all I can hear are the imperfections and I constantly compare myself with other people and so I'm in a constant state of wondering whether or not I'm good enough to continue trying because I honestly don't think my voice is good enough to make it to the top with the other Top Artists.. I recorded a bit of audio for you guys to listen to and all I want is straight feedback and I need to know judging off you( the reader's) experience and knowledge am I good enough and can I really get better? because I don't feel like I can.

1993 and the most influential appears to be....Ariana Grande. Honorable mentions are the other *Victorious* girls: Victoria Justice, Elizabeth Gilles. Also Miranda Cosgrove. From one Direction: Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Liam Payne. 

KSI is a fairly popular Youtuber, I guess. Also Fred if you remember old Youtube. Pete Davidson. I'll mention Taylor Momsen and Annasophia Robb because I think they're cute. Suga from BTS. Chance the rapper. Naomi Scott aka Jasmine. IU.  Tiffany...Trump?

So most (all)  of the more well known people born in my year are from entertainment. Interesting. I wonder if it is different for other Millennial years.

Substitute your year in these links to see:

I hate Death Grips. I immediately lose respect for anyone who listens to them, and especially those who praise them. Here's why:

Name 20 successful people that listen to them. Pop basically runs the show when it comes to music. This includes artists like Kanye West, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Zayn Malik, Adele, Katy Perry, Beyonce et al. Pop has artists making significant contributions to the entire music industry.

Death Grips on the other hand pulls most of the heavy weight packaging from teenage angst with each album. They then lay basic synths and a joke of a rapper over it. It generally lags behind pop by a mile or two in inventiveness. I never hear their music in shops or mentioned by anyone over the age of 25.

So tell me again, how exactly do Death Grips innovate? They even struggle to release a new theme with each release, and artwork is about the only original thing with Death Grips.

Yes, Death Grips is stable because they are standing on the shoulders of socially awkward teenagers. Most of the hard work is hashed out before they ever start making "music". This is fine, and what music is all about, but I prefer to be in with the leaders rather than the followers.

What really irks me and what has really brewed my hatred are Death Grips fans. They seem to think Death Grips is responsible for all that is good in the music world. I have just proven how false this is. In my experience, Death Grips fans (virgins, teenagers, and manchildren) are much less helpful than the alternative.

If you want nice pop, listen to Bruno Mars or Taylor Swift. If you like rock, Tame Impala. If you prefer, Drake or Kendrick Lamar. But please, don't feed the idiot magnet that is Death Grips!
Ok, so my hair's pretty thick and somewhat wavy. It's really annoying when a the tips of my fringe it curls back and looks bad and doesn't have texture, and I want my hair to go forward and that doesn't help with that. I'm going for a Zayn Malik style quiff, should I get my hair thinned so it can look more effortless? Basically, how can I get texture with thick hair?













see i'm 18 and i'm gonna be totally frank, i'm deluded. i still believe in having a chance to date Harry Styles or Zayn Malik‚Äî which, is a neat bow tie wrapped around my fake charmed personality. I like day dreaming so much. And to recently have developed this mad craze for Mass Communication, is astounding. Its astounding in the ways that it has fuelled me w so much motivation that, a day around Locals of my country digs arrows at my skin, begging me to change my direction towards the upper class. I wanna see the world, i wanna be something in the world. And i'm losing hope. I have no idea where to start from, i have no idea if it would even end. What if i'm trading one dream for another. 
But if theres one thing i am sure of, it is that i wanna write. i wanna wrote to the level that screams on the screens. 
any irrelevant experience or thoughts of yours on me are welcomed.











There's this song with a male singer who is possibly Zayn Malik. In one part he sings a long note and autotune comes in, making it sound like he's singing a ton of different notes very quickly. I always thought that this part sounded like a robot throwing up. I can't remember any of the lyrics though. I've heard it on the radio a million times! It could be a remix of something.



1. I am grateful for Borat. For me his old material from the U.K. and USA for the Ali G TV series is timeless. It cracks me up so much. Literally the funniest stuff I have seen (along with Paul Chowdhury‚Äôs YouTube videos about Zayn Malik which also crack me up). I can always come back to these videos and get a laugh. Literally seen all of the Borat stuff many times over but I still love it. One of my favourites is ‚ÄúBorat goes to acting school‚Äù on YouTube.

2. I am grateful for my electric guitar. I really wanted to play my acoustic guitar at around 1am but didn‚Äôt want to annoy the neighbours and then remembered I could just play my electric unplugged. Was cool just to play for a bit and made progress on the song I‚Äôm writing.

3. I am grateful for my sister who I visited yesterday. I would say after my mum who is no longer here, she is the one who gets me the most. She‚Äôs really intelligent and gives good advice and is a really good listener too when we have a quiet moment. I used to love watching films with her and also having late night chats with her over the last few years. One of my favourite times was one weekend where we sat talking for hours and also watched Arrival.

4. I am grateful for the view outside my window.
I get to watch squirrels and look at huge trees. It‚Äôs a rarity to have a view of a garden in the area where I live, so I‚Äôm pretty thankful to have a serene view outside my windowZ

5. I am grateful for the ability to walk. It blows my mind that tiny electric sparks from my brain cascade along neurones and down my spine to create movement. It blows my mind. Sometimes I‚Äôm walking around and think wow it‚Äôs such a delicate and intricate process and allows me to move my legs and get around. The spine is so complex full of all sorts of ‚Äúwiring‚Äù to aid walking. It‚Äôs a beautiful process.

6. I am grateful for showers. I love the feeling of the water hitting my skin. All these thousands of droplets hitting my skin give a sensory experience that helps wake me up daily. No matter how many showers I have I will never tire of that feeling of having one. It‚Äôs rejuvenating.

7. I am grateful for the park near my house. I love to sit there and journal / read a book / hang with a friend. It‚Äôs a pleasant place. People come  there to have a chat and others come to play chess there.

8. I am grateful for chess. I only recently started to learn to play. I love the strategy involved and I love the fact that 64 squares and 32 pieces can bring about 16 million possible/different games. That blows my mind. If a game with 64 squares has this many possibilities, then something as dynamic as the life/world we live in has an endless ocean of opportunities. Infinite possibilities. That is a beautiful thing. Endless endless opportunities. It is awe inspiring and exciting.

9. I am grateful for my holiday in Budapest. That was such a cool trip going as a group of four. It was freezing cold, but we had so much fun out there. The apartment we stayed in was really classy. So beautifully decorated and the place was solid. I would actually love to own property out there. Such a solid building. You could jump around like a mad man and no one could learn you in the floor below because the stone soaked up all the sound and vibration. We had fun going out too to one of the clubs there. Was really cool. Ate some good food. Even went to the opera which was an experience. Til this day we quote lines from that in operatic voices just for jokes. One line in particular always get a laugh. Great times.

10. I am grateful for one of my friends, N, who I studied with. This guy is so funny. He‚Äôs a bit more serious these days but the man has the ability to crack me up. Some of the quips he comes up with would make my stomach hurt cos I‚Äôd laugh so much. He‚Äôs a really good guy and is a very caring genuine person too.


Can your hairline be perfect but your crown be thinning?

I'm 23 male, and I have one of the baby hairlines as my friends call it (look up Zayn Malik's hairline if you wanna see what it looks like. Also another example is Paul George). Needless to say, from the front there are no signs of baldness.

I'm more paranoid about the crown. I have a cowlick (always have) which makes it more difficult to assess if I'm balding because I don't know if its my cowlick or I'm actually thinning. Moreover, I wear a hat sometimes which I heard could exaggerate things.

So yeah, anyone know if you balding ever manifests initially at the crown (with no initial recession at the hairline)?

I mean come on. Everyone only likes it because it‚Äôs Zayn. Besides that, it‚Äôs really just straight up bad compared to the one from the movie by Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott which is obviously way better. The Zayn one was unnecessary and was just made for marketing

...if you haven't read anything else at all today. Technically that'll make this simultaneously the worst thing you've read today but don't be so pessimistic. I already hate that about you.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello! I am a 25 year old male currently residing in London (Best city on Earth and all that), looking for Fs in London or wherever otherwise. I‚Äôm a University and Masters degree graduate doing this whole working thing at the moment, currently training as a Lawyer. Yeah, exciting right? But wait - there's more!

&amp;#x200B;

\* I used to be a model - the lifestyle wasn't thrilling enough for me, hence me pursuing a career in Law obviously.

\* I bought a guitar that I promised to learn to play for my new year's resolution. I can know play 1 chord on it, when can I start touring worldwide?

\* I was once the best competitive Pokemon player in the World - at least act impressed with that if nothing else :(

\* For some reason, I know the lyrics to every 90s/00s Rap/RnB/Hip Hop song ever recorded; definitely my useless talent.

\* OWNS A NETFLIX ACCOUNT (apparently that's a big deal?).

\* The song currently playing as I type this is Love Stoned - Justin Timberlake. Important? Maybe. Makes this list look longer? Definitely.

\* I have been mistaken for Zayn Malik multiple times, usually on my travels to America which I'm not sure if I should take as a compliment? My voice is much nicer.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from all that, my interests include various fitness activities such as going to the gym very regularly, playing basketball and boxing nearly every week, and occasionally rock climbing and football. Reading is always fun and you can pretty much always find me walking because who doesn‚Äôt like a good walk? I‚Äôm also lucky enough to travel a lot and when I‚Äôm not seeking my next adventure I‚Äôm probably playing a video game or perhaps browsing /r/me_irl.

I can't give you all the juicy stuff here though, you're gonna have to message me for the rest tbh. I have lots to talk about I promise! Feel free to PM me anything at all. Got a good story? Need life advice? Wanna rant about something? Debate? Write haikus? I'm all yours. Would be great to get to know some new people too :)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm off to refresh my inbox every minute - see you there?

I just woke up right now and realized I fucked up getting a buzz cut last night. I was looking for something different and thought I‚Äôd look like Zayn Malik, but instead I look like the Dalai Lama.

When he started shaving, it looked more porcupine than Justin Timberlake. 

I have a hot date with a fireman...what the fuck have I done üò±



So this guy is a freshman at the university and I'm on my senior year, last semester there was an activity where my group needed to organize activities for the new kids so all my friends and I added them on their facebooks, he then started to follow me on twitter and I followed him back because I recognized him. Anyway, he started to like some of my tweets and then he "loved" my profile pic, and the other day at the hallway he started small talk. My friends told me they heard his friends making fun of him for liking me and I feel a little bad about it.

This is going to sound so wrong but I have a really strong preference for white guys. I'm brown but I've always been "the brown" from my group of friends. You would think it's mexico and skin doesn't matter but if you are mexican you know it does, at an extent. Whitexican people usually have it better, and my family isn't wealthy but my parents have like two jobs each to make sure me and my sister get the best education. I've been on private schools all my life and to be honest that means it's like 65% white people to 35% brown people.

So I've always hang out with mostly white kids, my best friend is brown like me, but the rest of my friends are all white, and also kinda rich. Now at the university my group of girl friends are all white and I'm the only brown one, and I never really put much attention to it, until one of them pointed out how I always have crushes on white dudes, while (except for one) all of them are usually after brown dudes.

And I started to think how true it is, and it's not like I've never had a crush on a brown guy, because I have but I never really dated them. I just date white guys, and I truly don't find this new kid attractive, and he posts things about DJ's and stuff that just doesn't match with me, and he is like really young in my eyes, but also he is brown.

I've always assumed I like white guys because I grew up around them and honestly never thought this before because I was all head over heels for Zayn Malik just a couple years ago, and now about Calum Hood who it's beautiful but I just feel like maybe I'm being kinda racist? Which is dumb because I'm also brown but like can it be? I feel really guilty because maybe I am putting a lot of weight on his physical appearance and just not giving him a chance without knowing his personality. Should I give him a chance?

TL;DR: one of my friends pointed out I only date white guys and I'm brown, and this brown freshman likes me but I'm really not interested because I don't find him attractive and he's also too young. But I feel guilty that I could be putting a lot of weight on his physical and not even bothering to know his personality. Should I give him a chance? Am I being racist even tho I'm brown too?











I reall like that song even tho I don‚Äôt speak urdu, I like how slow and emotional it is. Is there a name for this genre of music? What other artists or songs like this one are?

Title says it all, I want my eyelashes to grow insanely thick and long. I naturally have thick lashes according to what people say but I want it noticeably thick like Zayn Malik LOL
What's your favorite song by Zayn Malik?


Personally mine would be Zayn Malik in his earlier years
Alright. So I'm a 22 year old Persian dude. Here's what I've come to find:

The mainstream bigger rappers blowing up nowadays all obviously have either 1 of 2 things going for them.

1. They are either tremendously talented with their bars/wordplay/so on
2. They have created a persona either through antics or image that is memorable and extraordinary (often through shock value, i.e. pink dreads SoundCloud rapper starter pack)

There is no question most of the bigger mainstream younger acts fall into the 2nd category. Now with that being said, there is also no question that, despite the widespread reach of hip hop and rap culture, most of these acts are young black men. And when they're not, they're often latino (Lil Pump, 6ix9ine, so on) and seem to be given an N-pass. By this I don't mean they get to use the N word, I just mean they're "accepted" into the culture by a large enough amount of people to be cool and nobody questions their image that much (despite the occasional dreadlock cultural appropriation headline). Bottom line is, it's kind of become a norm for them to have coloured dreads, or simply rock some form of natural african-american hairstyle (think Blueface).

Now, flash back to me, the 22 year old Persian brown dude that looks like something between Zayn Malik and the dude who was in Life of Pi. I am a decent rapper. I'm no master MC. I have no intention of becoming that, although I'm not closed to honing my skills. With that being said, I know someone in my position would be greatly helped by the addition of some visual proponents that would help make me memorable (i.e. SoundCloud rapper starter pack). In other words, I'd gladly be a part of the 2nd category of rappers that needs that extra push to become relevant or make noise at first and gain an audience.

But since the only relevant "mainstream" rap act of my complexion/look seems to be Nav, I am honestly at a loss in terms of what my hairstyle "should be" in an effort to be different enough from the masses and not too crazy weird to be called out and become a "cultural appropriator" that just looks goofy. I hope this makes sense. I feel like we  see Middle Eastern entertainers so rarely, particularly in the sphere of music and rap more specifically, that just being a brown dude is enough to be "different" and maybe that's not even in a good way. I feel like a brown dude with Lil Pump's hairstyle would look goofier to the masses of rap culture than Lil Pump, as a Latino from Florida, did even before becoming "Lil Pump". In my opinion, this is because of stereotypes still attached to brown men, that they are weak, nerdy, mamas boys or whatever else.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Most new big mainstream rap acts are Black (some Latino), and have coloured dreads and this is an accepted norm within the genre, but that hairstyle still serves as a stark contrast with the average Joe you'd come by on the street and therefore aids in memorability/branding. There are arguably no popping mainstream rappers that are Brown (middle eastern/asia) except Nav. What do you think in terms of hairstyle would work best for a brown rapper such as myself (goal being: to set oneself appart from the average Joe and still not be too weird for the rap game as a minority brown dude with stereotypes already attached to my look)?
V just looks like Zayn Malik!!


[He](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/11/41/0911417be288748b75968d155bf0daf7.gif) looks incredible. Currently 26. 

As a non white guy I look up to him.

Do you think he looks better when he dyes his hair a lighter color?

I love it when he embraces who he is
