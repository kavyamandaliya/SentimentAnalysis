This is an update to [this post I made a few days ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dyfgwd/exgirlfriend_28f_for_1_year_together_for_10_years/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Thought I'd post this here, just so y'all know how things are going, as new events have unfolded.

I changed my locks the day after I got that last disturbingly short and demanding email from her.  I saw the email as a threat and predicted that at some point in the next week she was going to show up demanding "her" dog.

An hour or so ago, that's exactly what she did.

Since I got her last email, I've been in the habit of deadbolting and locking all of my doors regardless of what I'm doing or what time of the day it is.  I've made sure to never leave **P** in a situation where she could be snatched.

After she rang the doorbell, I peeked through the blinds to see her car in my driveway.  I just sat where I was and didn't make a sound, but quickly realized it was pretty clear that my dog and I were home.  A few minutes later, she banged loudly on the door.  I got up from where I was and went to the door (bad move in retrospect, could've been shot if there was a gun involved).  I told her that I didn't appreciate her coming over unannounced and that if she didn't leave I was going to call the cops.  She responded with something about "not wanting to take my dog."

I told her that I wasn't opening the door and she should leave.  And then I heard another voice, from an (effeminate) male.  Calling me a "pussy" and attempting to shame me for not letting **J** see **P**.  He said if I didn't give up **P** right now that they'd be back and they'd take my truck (to which **J**'s father still has the title), and that they'd "make my life hell."

He claimed to have called the cops already, that they were on their way to take **P**. I was pretty full of adrenaline at this point and was frustrated as fuck with my shitty iPhone and its insistence that I use google fucking hangouts to call anyone.  Ended up calling my parents, who are just a couple of miles away, first, simply out of the ease at which I could contact them over the sheriff.  Shortly after finally getting a hold of them, my ex and dude with her got in her car and left.  I called the sheriff.

I haven't had good experiences with law enforcement.  I was freaking out because I really have an aversion to the police and I do not trust them at all.  I wanted to just close my front door and deal with it outside on the deck.  My parents talked me out of it though, telling me that it was weird to have the police meet with me on my deck rather than in my house, and they helped me spruce up my living room and I felt better about a police officer coming in (thank god they did that).  I explained the situation and showed all of my documentation to the officer, the adoption documentation showing my name as the one who both adopted and paid for **P.**

He offered to put out a no-trespass on her and the dude that came by with her.  I was happy for anything after what had just happened.  Apparently if either one of them is caught on my property again they're looking at jail time.

**P** is now at my parents' house and I am here at my house, ready to call the cops if I see some headlights in my driveway.

I also sent an email to **J**'s father, trying to resolve the situation with the title.  I am ready to give up the truck if need be.  I am in the process of acquiring a firearm.

I definitely predicted it but still I just can't believe it got to this point after a year of amicability, that she thought escalation was the answer here.

Edit: Forgot to mention, when the cop who came by called me after talking to my ex, he told me that she asked him about civil action.  Is my next destination /r/legaladvice or can I depend on the fact that we were never married and I have documentation showing that I was both the one who adopted her and paid for her, along with all the back and forth texts with her about her essentially babysitting my dog and the texts where she clearly ignored me about getting her back until I told her I was on my way to pick her up, and the fact that my ex's name is nowhere on the adoption paperwork?  I did call the vet last week and changed her to my name and even told them about the situation and to not let my ex make any changes, and the person I talked to said they would write down that there was a conflict, so I'm hoping it helps a bit.  I wouldn't put it past her to try.  Do I seriously need a lawyer when I have all of this documentation in my name?

Edit #2:  I also have a check for $300 from her that I never cashed, out of principle or something like it.  She gave it to me 2-4 months after our breakup, and at the time it really felt like a pity check and just annoyed me, so I just left it on the coffee table and there it has remained since.  It's certainly in bad taste to try and cash it right now, but the moment I get served or whatever, you can bet I'm going to try to cash it and not warn her at all.




***Илон Маск презентовал нвый электропикап, устроив очередное яркое шоу. Что это значит для индустрии и поможет ли экологии планеты? Разбираем перспективы «тяжелого» электротранспорта.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Премьера «машины будущего»**

Презентация Tesla Cybertruck стартовала 22 ноября, в шесть часов утра по московскому времени. Электропикап, как и ожидалось, напоминал машину из легендарного фильма «Бегущий по лезвию». Собственно, в знак уважения этому фильму, действие которого происходит в ноябре 2019 года, презентацию перенесли на два месяца.

Несмотря на то что основатель Tesla Илон Маск обычно активен в соцсетях, ему удалось сдерживать себя до самого мероприятия: практически никакой информации о «Кибертраке» в Сеть не просочилось. А сдерживаться пришлось довольно долго: впервые информация о создании электропикапа была озвучена еще в 2017 году.

Долгожданная машина оправдала первые, визуальные ожидания. Появление Cybertruck на сцене произошло под пологом из лазерных лучей и сопровождалось вспышками огня. Сам Маск мастерски управлял публикой, шутил и вообще был в ударе — но к своему детищу отнесся с предельной серьезностью.

&amp;#x200B;

[Для тех, кому лень смотреть все мероприятие — пятиминутная подборка основных моментов \/ © The Verge](https://reddit.com/link/e0tnwq/video/o45vlepp7k041/player)

Автомобиль оказался хорошо подготовлен к любому апокалипсису и постапокалипсису (ну, разве что кроме внезапного появления черной дыры в Солнечной системе). Корпус электропикапа сделан из холоднокатанной нержавеющей стали. Она выдерживает удар кувалдой (что продемонстрировали прямо на сцене) и выстрел из пистолета калибра девять миллиметров (это показали только на плазменном экране).

Стекла машины также бронированные: их крепость один из ассистентов Маска продемонстрировал, бросая на стекло металлический шар с большой высоты. Правда, при испытании стекол в дверях машины они все же треснули, но это словно бы никого сильно не смутило.

[Илон Маск и треснувшие стекла. Бывает \/ © The Financial Express](https://preview.redd.it/st8q4z7u7k041.jpg?width=660&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0614876faa622e75341bebfb0384f3d1e46e2d7)

**Что он собой представляет**

Кратко о характеристиках: Tesla Cybertruck будет доступен в трех вариантах — с одним, двумя и тремя двигателями соответственно. Максимальный запас хода на одной зарядке — от 400 до 800 километров, в зависимости от версии. Грузоподъемность машины составляет полторы тонны, вдобавок Cybertruck способен тянуть за собой шеститонный прицеп.

Конечно, бурю комментариев вызвал дизайн машины. Ретрофутуристичный облик, вдохновленный, помимо «Бегущего по лезвию», еще одним из фильмов «бондианы» — «Шпион, который меня любил», — спровоцировал волну шуток о схожести с кирпичом и детским рисунком, незаметности для радаров и отсутствии дворников. Хотя по намекам Маска в Twitter уже можно было понять, что машина получится максимально брутальной и вызовет у многих отторжение.

https://preview.redd.it/0nywvqm48k041.png?width=661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d0dcff19a8631cf2b2e0ca72ca92d14b80a541b

Главным конкурентом машины станет Ford F 150. Хотя, откровенно говоря, прямых конкурентов у Tesla Cybertruck нет, поскольку машину с таким вызывающе нестандартным дизайном и на «электрическом топливе» на рынке вряд ли сыщешь. Так что настоящих соперников для электропикапа придется немного подождать.

&amp;#x200B;

**На шаг впереди конкурентов**

Несмотря на то что именно Tesla заработала репутацию технологического лидера в сфере электромобилей, лидером по продажам среди индивидуального электротранспорта является вовсе не одна из ее моделей. Самый популярный электроавтомобиль в мире — Nissan Leaf, выпускающийся с 2010 года. А за последние пару лет у компании начали появляться новые конкуренты, и теперь уже не получится смотреть на успешную модель Nissan как некую флуктуацию.

Например, в 2018 году компания Jaguar выпустила кросовер i-Pace, который в некоторых странах уже даже подвинул Nissan Leaf с первого места по продажам. Две модели презентовал концерн Volkswagen — это хэтчбек ID.3 и спорткар Taycan, который будет выпускаться под маркой Porsche. Электрокросоверную версию модели XC40 анонсировала компания Volvo. Наконец, несколько дней назад свой первый серийный электромобиль Mustang E-Mach презентовала компания Ford.

[Volkswagen ID.3 \/ © Smart Energy International](https://preview.redd.it/c0v8ks6a8k041.jpg?width=792&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=513758a0fc44531ffba8be526e312856b60ba0be)

В мире автомобильного производства в общем Volvo, Volkswagen и Jaguar —  куда более известные имена, чем Tesla. Набирающая силу волна популярности электромобилей затронула крупные корпорации, которые в силу своих возможностей способны просто выдавить компанию Маска со сцены. Дело даже не в производственных мощностях. «У старых производителей большой опыт производства автомобилей, они знают, как круто сделать интерьер, мягко, удобно, с аккуратными строчками. А Tesla не знает, и на нее все жалуются, что внутри не как в немецком автомобиле», — говорит Игорь Антаров, управляющий партнер Moscow Tesla Club.

На стороне Маска — умение делать зрелищное шоу из любого повода: никто ведь не помнит презентацию Jaguar i-Pace и когда она там была, верно? А еще Илон не боится рисковать: пока остальные автопроизводители осторожничают и не спешат «перекладывать яйца в другую корзину», в Tesla уже сосредоточились только на электромашинах.

Теперь бизнесмен первым идет осваивать новый участок рынка электрических автомобилей, ведь пока никто не знает, насколько успешными будут электропикапы и на что они вообще способны. Вот Маск и проверит. Уверенности экспериментатору добавляет динамика финансовых показателей фирмы. Если первый квартал 2019 года Tesla завершила с убытком в 702 миллиона долларов, то второй — всего 408 миллионов, а в третьем компания уже вышла в прибыль, заработав чуть менее 150 миллионов. Как вам такое, инвесторы?

&amp;#x200B;

**Что не так с «тяжелыми» электромобилями**

Cybertruck — вторая попытка Tesla выйти на рынок тяжелого электротранспорта. Первой ровно два года назад, в ноябре 2017 года, стал грузовик Tesla Semi. Шестиколесный седельный тягач, по заявлениям разработчиков, способен сдвинуть с места 36 тонн груза, проезжая на одной зарядке до 800 километров. Время полного заряда батареи Semi составляет 40 минут, а 80%-ного заряда — полчаса.

Правда, в серийное производства спустя два года машина так и не пошла. И неизвестно, пойдет ли (хотя начало выпуска в 2020 году уже анонсировали). Все же грузовые тягачи — это больше не про крутой имидж, а про выносливость, надежность и грузоподъемность. Среди «серьезных» грузовиков крупных компаний Semi с его футуристичным дизайном выглядит скорее PR-ходом. В Tesla явно изо всех сил пытаются это опровергнуть. Так, во время проведенных в августе этого года испытаний на грузоподъемность было объявлено, что запас хода на одной зарядке был увеличен до 965 километров. Куда более важная вещь, чем способность двери выдержать удар кувалдой.

[Tesla Semi в процессе испытаний на грузоподъемность \/ © X Auto](https://preview.redd.it/pwe5gr3e8k041.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3610fd00a58d2edb0ecb2ce33fc11462bb9d6dae)

Эти 965 километров — главный аргумент, который может заставить транспортные компании приобретать грузовики Tesla, ведь основные потенциальные конкуренты к этой цифре не подобрались и близко. Например, представленный в апреле 2018 года Volvo FL Electric способен проехать без подзарядки всего лишь 300 километров. Канадский Lion8, прозванный создателями «Apple в мире электрогрузовиков» и с помпой презентованный в марте 2019 года, может на одной зарядке пройти до 400 километров.

Большинство же электрогрузовиков просятся к розетке уже после 200 километров. Именно по этой причине многие крупные компании, такие как MAN, DAF и Mercedes-Benz, не выпускают электрические модели серийно, ограничиваясь экспериментальными прототипами. Коммерческие авто за них делают мелкие фирмы. И «за них» здесь не просто фигура речи. В Европе существует большое количество компаний, чьей основной или побочной деятельностью является переделывание бензиновых и дизельных грузовых авто в электромобили. Например, компания GINAF, которая производит тяжелые самосвалы, параллельно переводит на электричество машины DAF. А фирма BPW, выпускающая оси для грузовых прицепов, превращает в электрогрузовички автомобили Mercedes-Benz Vario.

Конечно, сфера применения подобных авто ограничена. Обычно они используются для доставки грузов в пределах городов — максимум пригородов. Или же для создания коммунальной техники, которая ездит недалеко, небыстро и всегда имеет возможность подзарядиться.

&amp;#x200B;

**Обманчивая экологичность**

Ни для кого не секрет, что тренд на электротранспорт во многом обусловлен борьбой с глобальным потеплением. Постоянные попытки урезать выбросы парниковых газов приводят к тому, что во многих странах автовладельцам предоставляют дотации на покупку «экологичного» автомобиля или снижают налог на владение машиной. Например, в Португалии и Дании электроавтомобили полностью освобождены от регистрационного сбора.

Но польза от электромобилей, заключающаяся в отсутствии вредных выбросов, может перекрываться вредом от батарей, которые выработали свой ресурс. Нормально перерабатывать их пока не умеют, а заниматься этим вопросом скоро придется. Ученые из Бирмингемского университета подсчитали, что батареи всех электромобилей, проданных за 2017 год, к истечению срока своей службы произведут 250 тысяч тонн токсичных отходов. А продажи электромашин год от года лишь растут…

[Переработка литий-ионных батарей — головная боль не только для Tesla \/ © Inhabitat](https://preview.redd.it/ogvmbh4i8k041.jpg?width=728&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb11f8c8d66587d9224cb94bf3747deab1d656dd)

Какое-то время отсутствие эффективных технологий переработки литий-ионных батарей не будет для нас угрозой. Гарантийный срок службы аккумуляторов Tesla Model 3, например, составляет восемь лет. К тому же в Tesla неоднократно заявляли о проектах предоставления батареям «второй жизни» — например, для домашнего использования, что может продлить срок службы еще на восемь-десять лет. Но по истечении этого срока проблема встанет в полный рост.

Конечно, ванговать о том, что подобная технология обязательно будет создана, можно как угодно долго и с очень умным лицом. Однако, помимо экологических проблем, которые, кажется, не берут крупные корпорации за душу, есть другой важный аргумент — литий, точнее, его ограниченное количество. Да, литий-ионные аккумуляторы производятся с 1991 года, но стоит учесть, что для батареи автомобиля необходимо примерно в сотню раз больше лития, чем в АКБ ноутбука, и в тысячи раз больше, чем для смартфона.

Пока что из-за переизбытка предложений на мировом рынке цены на литийсодержащее сырье держатся на относительно низком уровне. В 2017 году килограмм карбоната лития стоил более 20 долларов, теперь же цена упала ниже десяти долларов и, по прогнозам специалистов, продержится на этом уровне еще несколько лет, пока темпы развития рынка электромобилей недостаточно стремительны. Но компании, которые смотрят в будущее, должны найти способ обеспечить себя литием из отходов, пока его не станет мало в земной коре.

&amp;#x200B;

**Что ждет Маска и его пикап**

Будет ли успешен Cybertruck? С учетом всех факторов — роста рынка, уникальной (пока что) ниши, наличия ядра фанатов компании — скорее да, чем нет. Кстати, еще один немаловажный фактор будущей популярности, который мы придержали на конец статьи, — стоимость машины. Базовая версия Cybertruck с одним мотором и приводом на заднюю ось будет стоить 40 тысяч долларов. Для сравнения, Ford F-150 Lariat, один из конкурентов Cybertruck, оценили в 42,5 тысячи.

[Удар кувалдой Cybertruck выдерживает. Выдержит ли конкуренцию на рынке? \/ © Finder](https://preview.redd.it/k4wjgz9l8k041.jpg?width=738&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adf6562df52cc67758c1f7b42836203722d7d08e)

Безусловно, вполне комфортный пикап аналогичной грузоподъемности можно купить за меньшие деньги — пускай и с менее брутальным дизайном, без автопилота и с бензиновым двигателем. Далеко не всем это важно. Но суть Tesla совсем не в этом: их автомобили в большей степени высокотехнологичные гаджеты, чем просто средства передвижения, — как iPhone среди других смартфонов. Можно сколько угодно снобить владельцев этих авто, каламбурить на тему имени и фамилии Илона Маска и предрекать скорый крах его компании, но обладание Tesla уже автоматически означает попадание владельца в элитный клуб.

А если вам нужны реальные, а не пафосные аргументы в пользу электроавтомобилей в целом и Tesla в частности, то подумайте о моторе, который, в отличие от бензинового, практически не изнашивается. Подумайте о возможности зарядиться от любой розетки в 220В. Подумайте об отсутствии необходимости прогревать машину при старте с мороза и о бесшумности езды. В конце концов, эра бензина уже заканчивается.

I'd say this sub is the antithesis to the attitude of "No one will ever watch your cell phone concert footage."  I have spent hours watching different videos of this band's stage time, all taken by fans.  I own all their official concert footage, but there is so much I miss out on by not being able to see them live.  So to all the iphone/android cinematographers out there: Thank you!  I just hope you weren't blocking anyone's view...




I've been an avid traveler for most of my adult life -- lived in 30+ countries in my 20s, mostly in Africa and Latin America, usually 2bagging it with a 50+15L travel backpack situation, or sometimes with doc-making gear and stuff like that. I've one-bagged it for plenty of trips for a week or less, but don't reckon that counts.

I haven't traveled outside of Canada for 4 years, mostly due to being in a relationship with a newcomer whose passport situation made it difficult. *(We split a couple of months ago. Love of each other's life sort of deal. Been rough. Hence the trip).*

I'm going to Thailand for 3 weeks in February, mostly for diving and to reconnect with myself, but also excited to true onebag it for the first time in international travel. I know Thailand is touristy AF and doesn't offer much challenge or adventure, but it seems a good place to quite literally dip my toe back into the water, as I really miss diving and have never been to Asia.

My rough, general plan is to party in BKK for a couple of days, then head to Koh Lanta, and probably stick to the islands unless I get sick of diving and partying (Lanta, Phangan, Tao). I'm taking time off from my FT job, but I'm also a FT student and run a small business which I can't take time off from, so I'll have to put in at least 12-16/hrs week and need some sort of internet access for at least 30-60 minutes every couple of days.

I'll be taking a [Minaal CO 2.0](https://www.minaal.com/products/minaal-carry-on-bag), along with a [Matador FreeRain 2.0](https://matadorup.com/products/freerain24-2-0) in the bottle holder. I've got Specter Packing Cubes from back in the day, and might add a Peak Design one too. To handle work I'm bringing an iPad + Logitech k380 keyboard.

Now for questions! Thanks in advance for any feedback :)

* **Devices**: Headphone/music/phone: I'm hesitant to bring my new phone (iPhone 11) and AirPods Pro, mainly for fear of losing them, though I know they'll definitely make life easier if I bring them. I also have my functional iPhone 6s with the headphone jack, Bose QT 25s, and some cheaper TWBT earbuds: Anker Liberty Neos, as well as a decent pair of passive NC earbuds. But the Liberty buds don't have ANC, and the QT25s will be large, heavy and probably hot. I have trouble sleeping without an audiobook or podcast so I was planning on bringing an iPod classic and a couple of cheap sets of earbuds. If you were me, **would you go with the iPhone 6s + QT25s + Liberty Neos, or the iPhone 11 + Airpods Pro + PNC earbuds?** Option A is worth about $350-400, option B is worth about $1,300-1,400.
* **Footwear**: I'm planning on bringing my trusty old chacos, which are well-worn and have been with me through 20+ countries, since they are great for support, and can be used like flip flips. Will I want to bring shoes as well? Additional (cheap) flip flops? I was thinking to bring my [Cloudswifts](https://www.on-running.com/en-ca/products/cloudswift/mens/sand-grey) that are extremely light, breathable, and don't take up much space. **Would you recommend bringing these?** **Any better alternatives?** Worth mentioning, probably, that I'll be departing and returning in extremely cold temperatures.
* **Clothing:** Reckon I'm better off with Merino, or Linen, primarily? I've done my research on the sub around shorts, and find that the vast majority of love seems to be for board shorts -- I'm a strictly above-the-knee kinda guy though, and usually like an inseam of 6-9 inches (I'm 5'9 with a big torso and thiccc legs, so board shorts make me look like an overgrown dwarf). I was looking at the prAna Brion shorts, and maybe lululemons. Oliver All Over Shorts look great, but seem impossibly expensive to get in Canada -- like $300 for two pairs, after shipping and duties.
* **Anything else? &lt;3**

Thanks so much for reading. This has been the hardest two months of my life, but booking this trip and researching the mastery of onebagging has been a great diversion. I really appreciate you taking the time to read this, and any advice you can offer. I'll post photos of my final packing, if that's something that I can contribute to the community in return!


Are phones better or do I just suck?

I went out in a nature park with my DSLR and a friend who just had his iPhone (9 I think). Most of his shots looked way better than mine. 

I have a fairly cheap DSLR, Nikon D3500 but I have a few lenses. 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6g which came with it, 55mm 1.8f, and 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 VR.

In comparison my shots looked bland, even the same shot. Mainly the lighting just looked better on his phone shots. The only place my camera shined was in telephoto and close up (bokeh) but for landscape shots and regular it didn't look anywhere near as good. I shot mostly manual but a bit of auto too and the only way I can describe it is my shots looked flat / lifeless in comparison to his.
Hey everyone, I am back with the second month of progress for my "self-published iPhone guide for senior citizens" business. Firstly I want to thank everyone for all the feedback I received on my first post (linked below), I honestly expected my post to go unnoticed, so it was pretty cool reading everyone's comments. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/dlsavj/iphone\_guide\_for\_senior\_citizens\_96225\_first\_month/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/dlsavj/iphone_guide_for_senior_citizens_96225_first_month/)

If you have read my first post, the first thing you might notice about this write up is the significant difference in revenue generated. I considered Month 1 to be a pretty solid start (nearly reaching $1k) however everything has declined. This is pretty much the theme of the second month as very little progress was made due to the fact that I had my second semester university exams. My exams finished on the 18th of November and I am currently focused on making the most of the 3 month break with the goal of breaking even by semester 1 2020.

Throughout Month 2, I was spending about 6 - 8 hours a day studying. I would wake up, have my coffee, revise notes, complete past papers and usually by the end of it I was mentally exhausted. Even when I was reaching the end of the exam period and had more free time  I had little to no motivation to do any kind of work and honestly dreaded looking at my computer screen unless it was procrastination. I just kept telling myself that I would “do it when exams are over”. I am sure mental blocks are something a lot of you could relate too, persistence is definitely an area I need to improve on and hopefully gets easier as I get older (I mean, I am a lot better at sitting down and doing work these days than I was at 18). 

To continue, All revenue generated in Month 2 came from reruns of the articles in local newspapers and the social website for seniors (I mentioned in the previous post) continuing to promote iGuide on their mailing list. I thought it would be a good idea to get some reviews so I waited about 1-2 weeks after the Month 1 pre-orders were sent out and personally emailed everyone who pre-ordered, thanking them for supporting the business and asked if they would kindly fill out a feedback form I created using Google Forms. 

The feedback from customers was overwhelmingly positive and had a high turn out. I've added testimonials on my website ([https://iguideforiphone.com](https://iguideforiphone.com/)). Only one customer complained about the instructions not making sense, however it turns out that he owned a Huawei and not an iPhone. My only problem with the feedback form was that it was rushed. When I made it, I didn't have a lot of spare time so I didn't sit down and brainstorm a solid set of questions. 

Because of this, I feel like I missed an opportunity to gather a lot of interesting data about my early consumer base, especially considering how hard it is to get people to fill out feedback. I have since improved the feedback form questions. Here are the questions on the new feedback form (Note: Question formats consist of Linear Scale (1 to 5), Short/Long answer and Yes/No):

1. How comfortable are you with your iPhone?
2. Is the content understandable? (Example: Is the text size big enough? Are the screenshots clear? Do the instructions make sense?)
3. What problems were you aiming to solve with iGuide?
4. How well does iGuide meet your needs?
5. How would you rate the value for money of iGuide?
6. If you could change something about iGuide, what would it be?
7. Would you recommend iGuide to a friend?
8. What is your age?
9. What is your gender?

Moving into month 3, I have been contacting the parent companies which own local newspapers to run ads and hopefully sponsored articles. I also contacted well known retirement company, to see if they would be interested in working with me and have been sending free copies of iGuide to various retirement village managers, who said they would pass the word on to their residence. I have mentioned that I'm happy to set up lessons as I believe it would be a more hands on experience that a lot of seniors would enjoy.

My goals for month 3 are:

* Invest more in marketing.
* Get in touch with more retirement villages (to help generate leads).
* Get a part-time job over the summer so I have more funds for the business.
Title pretty much sums it up. I’m moving into a job completely unrelated. Is it a cultural issue if I have Apple products? Or will no one care?

Thanks, and I’m looking forward to contributing.
So for context I have a villa and its in the US (where I live) and I was traveling to Korea to see my friends. This is all translated from Korean. I came out from Incheon Airport and I see my friends in the car. I tell them to let me stay for an hour to shop. We were talking about cars and I brought up my villa (in America). An Em and her kid comes up and asks about my house.

Em: I HeArD Y0u hAvE a NiCe HoUsE!

Me: Um yeah I do.

Em: give me it!

Me: Um no.

Em: I can trade!  My home is rEaL NiCe.

Me: okayyy  show me ur home.

Em then proceeds to pull out her cracked iPhone 5 to show me a tiny apartment with one bedroom and there was at least two cockroaches. I proceed to laugh.

Me: AHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHahhAHAHAHAHAH. Even if I was dumb enough to trade, my house is halfway across the world!

Em: No it's no-

I cut her off, told her there was free Gucci, and we sneak out and at the exit, and then I flip her off. Her son comes up and says the following:

Nk: I feel good for you and I wish I had a great life like you. My mom is a real sh\*tty c\*nt.

We wave at the kid with smiles and we gave him some money. We drove to a McDonalds which Em stalked us in her beat up Chevy Spark while my friend had a BMW 335i (modified) so it took a while for her to catch up with us. Em tried to "accidentally spill her ketchup on my Gucci bag but before she could, I move the packet in front of her face and my friends laugh off and in English, say that she was a shitty piece of shitty bullshit. Em then transforms this from a house issue to vegan bullshit.  

Em: can u not eat those non-vegan fries?! Those have the lives of innocent animals and ur just eating them!

Me: no these are salted potatoes with no animals you hippie piece of bullshitty bullshit.

Em: I am your elder! you listen to m- I cut her off and tell her this:

Me: listen, if you say something remotely about veganism, I will unhinge your jaw and throw it out of a plane! 

Em runs off crying as this bullshit was done with and I got to enjoy my trip.

ok so i have this issue where i mix and master my beats but when i listen to the beat on my iphone with my iphone headphones the beat is to low but when i turn up the volume the 808 sounds very mushy. Then i end going through this process where i tweak the beat and again and listen again back on my iPhone before i post the beat on instagram. i listen to the beat on my headphons because i noticed that when i listen to other people's beats on my phone with my earphones the mixing and mastering is clean. I wanted to know does anyone here use ozone 8 to master there beats for instagram. and whether is good or not

Has anyone else had this issue? I’ve tried all sorts of resets, and it just seems to come and go on it’s own. 

I’m assuming I’ll have to take it in to be fixed, but I find it odd how it’s not always there???

I've noticed my game has crashed a lot today, perhaps 3 times. I know this isn't as bad as the worst of it back in march where you couldn't play 2/3 of your games without it crashing, but it's still enough to be annoying. I'd say my game has crashed today in 10% of my games. Anyone else experiencing this happening more perhaps since the last patch? I'm on an iPhone 8.
I’d like to upgrade my phone (SE) and get the new iPhone 11 but was wondering what the cheapest option was. I’ve heard that Telus has a $0 promotion with a variety of competitive plans but what is the best avenue to buy?
-direct from Apple
-direct from carrier (e.g. Telus)
-big box store (e.g. Best Buy)

I know these options are relatively similar and may only vary based on current promotions and add-ons but aside from being the most economical, is there one that is better than the others - in terms of ease of setup/inventory etc. Any advice is appreciated, hoping to upgrade this week during Black Friday deals.

Guess I don’t need to buy a fleshlight.

Zylon Defenders, a first-person 3D shooter inspired by Star Raiders



I'm the kind of person who plays games on my phone from time to time, and I also kinda suck with keeping track of my storage. enough so that i can end up taking up 58 GB of storage on a 64 GB phone. I was getting fed up with this and decided i would look for a way to expand the storage on my iPhone 6s plus somehow, and now I'm looking at flash drives for iPhones. i'm a little giddy with adding 128 GB of space to my iPhone, but as I dug around, I started to realize that I couldn't find anything about loading apps into the flash drives. the one i'm looking at is a sandisk ixpand USB lighting flashdrive, and i cant figure out if it can store apps. can it? because i don't want to buy it and find out i can't use it the way i want to :/
My phone is always on silent. I didnt hear the civil defence test emergency alert that happened a short time ago - should I be able to override silent mode? It would be great to know that I’ll receive a notification in a real emergency
I decluttered my iPhone today by getting rid of everything google . No more gmail google maps waze Google photos google etc etc it’s ridiculous how much google had on me and I deleted it all. Suddenly my iPhone is super fast. Going to use all Apple products now as I have an iPhone there isn’t any reason to have google stuff on my phone.
I'm coming from a Oneplus 3, I was set on just getting the latest Oneplus phone but recently I've come around to wanting an iPhone due solely to iMessage and the Apple ecosystem since all my friends have iPhones and we constantly message each other.  Unfortunately, Google hasn't innovated its own uniform messaging, which is making me seriously consider an iPhone. Yet, I really like Oneplus UI. I'm equally divided.
Didn’t no where to post this but I have an unlimited data plan with att and just found out that I can’t use the hotspot on it without paying extra and was wondering if there was anyway to bypass this. I’m on iOS 13.1.3

Unless you have a home phone with a base we don’t “hang up the phone” anymore. I was born in the 90s my grandmother came to this country from Portugal in the 60s And I have very fond memories of her walking the kitchen with a 15ft phone cord behind her. When she was done with the call she “hung up the phone” on the wall. Nowadays with iPhone and androids  and the lack of home phones we aren’t “hanging up” calls just pushing a button. Am I overthinking this or is it a relevant matter?
Hello, I have an iPhone 5 on 9.3.2 and would like to keep it that way. Unfortunately it’s disabled because I’ve tried to guess my old passcode too many times. So I can’t get inside to restore without updating. It will connect to iTunes but tries to force an update after restoring. Is there any way around this? It is not showing up in iCloud.  At one point it was jailbroken with Home Depot if that makes a difference. 

Thanks
My dad had affairs commonly and this weekend I have a chance to bust him.

Ok sooooo let’s start off at the beginning. All the way back to 2011. That is when my dad started having affairs(as far as I know). It was a common thing with this girl all the way up to 2015, 2016. He did it regularly and I assume lied to my mom. Then near the end of last summer looking through my dads old iPhone I found texts with girls names I had never heard of, even some with hearts. After looking at the texts I took pictures of the texts and left it at that. I though my that since he stopped I wouldn’t have any reason to do anything but if he started again I could use them. Fast forward to this Thursday, the day that he left for his business trip, I looked at his phone and on a messaging I had never seen before I saw a text saying, “lets have fun the the casino this weekend.” I didn’t believe it at first but I looked at his most recent old phone. It had a password but after a few tries I got it. Luckily it was still connected to all the accounts and I didn’t have much trouble. After looking through a bunch of texts with a bunch of different woman. I took photos of every single one and put the phone back where I found it. My dad is away from town and I could bust him or black mail him this weekend. The only thing stopping me is that he provides for our family. My mom is a stay at home mom and he recently sold on if his companies for a million dollars. Another thing stopping me is that it’s close to thanksgiving and Christmas and I don’t want to make it a hard time for my mom. Any advice would be awesome and I am very conflicted and don’t know what to do. 
Reposted because no one saw my other one.


In iOS 13 on an iphone 11 pro max, is there a way to set the personal hotspot to use a specific SIM? Basically I want to take the SIM out of my hotspot, put it in my iPhone, and just use it to be a hotspot.
They scrapped the widget and completely changed the UI to some clunky dial garbage and you now have to scroll to the ~~bottom of the~~ next page to see rain forecast and half the info I used to get is just gone.  It went from the best (IMO) weather app to compete garbage in just a day.  I may hunt down an old version and lock out updates.  I'm using WeatherBug as a stand-in till I find something better.

Taking suggestions if anyone has some.

[Screenshot of the new UI](https://i.imgur.com/IEE34UN.jpg)

Edit: I'm mostly just pissed about losing the widget.  I'm not a damned iPhone user.  I *like* widgets.
I have always been an apply boy. Only ever used iphones until now. I recently came across a video about why apple products are getting so expensive. It boggles my mind that the price hike is not necessarily because of better quality than other phones but rather they are exploiting the brand loyalty from their loyal customers! I'm sorry but this irritates me to the point where I finally want to switch to something else.

If the only reason apply wants me to buy their new overpriced phone is because if no other reason other than that they can charge their zombie loyal fans a premium, then....I'm sorry I want out of this madness. 

I am not spending $1000+ on a phone.

I am in canada and phone and wireless service is expensive as it is.

Features that are important to me in a phone, it really just is about one feature. Ease of use. I am inclined towards google pixel but heard they are close to $1000? not sure.

Ideally want a phone that has a headphone jack and has better everything than my current iphone 8 and one that I can buy for under $800 cad.
I’m looking for an iP8+, iPX, or iPXR in good condition, preferably unlocked or with T-Mobile/AT&amp;T

iPhone SE, Moto Z3 Play or Galaxy A50? Why?
Literally the worst experience I've ever had with a company.

I placed my order on Thursday afternoon for an iPhone through their shop with my port information. Order was declined and I received a text from my bank to verify the transaction. I verified and placed the order again. I got the email saying "**We got your payment."** at 3:30PM EST. Later on at 5:00PM I get the email "**Woo - your order is on its way!"**

I talked with chat support the next morning to ask for the tracking number because I never received it. The person proceeds to tell me that my order wasn't shipped because it was placed after 3PM. The FAQ states that orders placed before 3PM **CENTRAL TIME** are shipped the same day, 3:30PM EST = 2:30PM CENTRAL. Apparently they didn't understand time zones because even after I explained that they kept repeating that it was placed after 3PM like a broken record. The next person I connected to started off claiming the same thing about the time, but looked further into my account and confirmed that my order wasn't shipped and that the bank rejected the payment and therefore I needed to contact my bank and place the order again.

I saw that my charge was still pending with my bank, so I waited before placing another order. At this time I noticed that when I logged into my Visible account, my order and payment history were gone. There was no trace of my order on my page. I open another chat with support and now they say there's no active order on my account and to place my order. I waited to see what happened with the pending charge.

The charge posted this morning. Visible again says that they didn't receive payment and my order wasn't processed. Okay, so I talk to my bank and tell them that and that they want me to place my order again. They go ahead and open a case for the charge. When I try to go back to add the device to my bag to place my order again, I now get an error and can't proceed. I go back and forth with chat and they finally fix the issue. While putting in my order information I realize the porting information I initially put was incorrect, so I fix that. My bank again declines the payment and I receive the text to verify. But when I go back into my account, I can see my Payment and Order history again. It showed the 2 rejected payments and the one that posted. Visible support opened a ticket for me because they said my order was processed multiple times and they need to figure out what went wrong.

Ok, I log in a few hours later and see the 2nd order now isn't showing up on my account. So I ask Visible support if the issue was resolved. Now, I don't know why the hell this was the only person who was able to find this information, but after looking at my account they send me the link to the tracking information. So it was indeed shipped and it shows delivered and signed for. I wasn't home in the afternoon during the time it was delivered, so I say hang on and I check with my neighbor. OMG THEY HAD IT! I don't know why they didn't let me know as I saw them outside earlier but the box was open so I assume they saw what it was and hoped I wouldn't come looking for it. Seriously, all this headache because apparently Visible employees either don't all have access to the same information, or lack the training to find it.

Now, I open the box and find there is no SIM. I'm still connected with support and they tell me to place a BYOD SIM order. While doing this I see that it shows a $100 gift card promo in my order preview. I ask to make sure that it'll be the $200 promo that I qualified for with my device purchase, and NOW THEY TELL ME that I didn't port my number with my order because I didn't get the SIM. I assure them that I definitely did but I entered the wrong account information for my port. But they insist that I now can't get the $200 gift card for my order. So apparently it's my fault that they're incompetent and decided to cancel my port and not ship my SIM instead of confirming the account information with me.

I've requested a call and supposedly will be getting a call from a supervisor tomorrow. This is absurd. If they refuse to give me the promotion I qualify for I'll ask for a refund and send the phone back. This is way too much to deal with a mobile carrier.
anyone else have a crazy stutter bug that causes them to freeze at any given point anywhere from a couple seconds to almost a minute at its worst? I play on an iphone xr which can consistently run 60fps on 100% 3D res. Any ways to counter it?

Hey!

I just started playing Sky. I'm at the very begining of the game, and it is asking me to forge a light tribute. I'm playing with a PS4 control but it says "Press LB to forge a light tribute". I tried L1 and L2 and nothing lol. Could you help me with this please?

Thanks!

PS: btw, I'm streaming my iPhone to my Apple TV, so playing on the TV. Looks very nice, the graphics are so cute in this game!
Everyone in my group of friends has an I-phone except this one girl. 

Am I the asshole for not letting her into the group chats? I do send her important info about plans.

The reason is if a non iPhone user enters the group chat it loses it status as an I chat and everyone will lose the benefits of an I chat.

The iPhone will come in the original box it was bought in with an OEM apple lightning charger and adapter (not pictured here).


The iPhone has a glass screen protector on the front, and the back glass is cracked. Underneath the glass screen protector there are only minor scratches that are not noticeable except for under intense light when the screen is off. The iPhone functions normally.


There are virtually no scuffs on the stainless steel sides, with the only exception I am aware of being on the top left corner of the phone where the stainless steel has a tiny scuff which is barely noticeable.


The iPhone is currently on iOS 12.4 and it is currently jailbroken.


Please feel free to contact me with any questions and I will be happy to answer them!

I have iOS 13.2.2 on my iPhone X and when switching apps, apps get killed and reloaded too often. I assume this is the same backgrounding bug that Apple supposedly patched? Anyways, it’s so annoying that I’m ready to upgrade/downgrade iOS versions. 

What options do I have? Can I do iOS 13.1.2 even though it’s not signed? What about in 13.2.3, is the bug is fixed?

TIA

When I'm using the IOS app for discord there seems to be this strange input lag for almost everything, from sending messages, switching DM tabs, and even opening the keyboard and emoji tab. The lag is upwards of 5 to 10 seconds. This is the only app that is doing this on my phone. I've tried switching wifi networks, and even tried mobile data to no avail. Discord on my PC is running smoothly with no issues, as well as the app on my friends phones. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app with no success. When I type out messages the send button won’t even appear for a solid 5 seconds.

I’m running IOS 12.4.3 on my iPhone 6s, and I haven’t had any issues with the app up until recently, does anyone know how to combat this?
Hi all,

I'm trying to use blender as a video editor and render a video to post on instagram app from my iphone. I'm using dropbox to send the video to my iphone after rendering it on my desktop. 

When I download it onto my iphone, the video file gets corrupted, transforming the video into a muted clip, with a long black screen pause in the video. I'm thinking this is an encoding issue, using a format that's incompatible with iphone.

Is there an export  setting I should change? I've tried converting the video file using VLC as well; converting it to "H.264 + MP3 (MP4)" video file.

Hi guys, hope you can help me on this one. My dad has the iPhone X and has been working fine until today that just turned off by itself and it won’t turn on. I’ve tried connecting it and charging it and it won’t. Any idea what’s happening? Appreciate it.

I keep getting the _assert error. And from my research I think apple is blocking something. But can i jailbreak with unc0ver and still get TetherMe still?
So I’ve been in varsity track and field for two years (I’m a junior) but I’m wondering if this also counts as an EC. 

My grandmother lives with us. She has since I was 6 years old. She doesn’t know a any English. So if she needs computer help, I help her. I also taught her how to use her iPhone to call people. If she’s watching a movie or a tv show, I usually sit and translate things to her. If she needs help cooking, I help her. I also help my parents with phone calls since their English isn’t great as well. I run errands with my mom and dad a lot too. I also have to help with other things like how to use Netflix, translating an article or how to spell something. 

Does that count for something? I’m just wondering since I don’t have very many EC so I’m trying to think about things I do a lot, that are still important enough to be considered an EC.
**Huawei Nova 6 SE is built on the Kirin 810 platform**

The first image of the promising smartphone Huawei Nova 6 SE has appeared on the Web - it will be presented simultaneously with Nova 6 on December 5th. In the picture (apparently, a fragment of the official advertising booklet is captured) - a smartphone with an embedded front camera and the main camera with four lenses, designed in the spirit of the iPhone 11 Pro.

So when she had a Samsung, she would constantly criticize my phones and talk about how iPhones in general are bad and that she prefers Samsungs. Seems reasonable so far.... but then one random day she goes and buys the IPhone 11 after my brother motivates her for a bit by saying things like “you’ll have the best and the newest phone in of the family” &amp; “You’ll have a better phone than OP”. I ended up showing her how it works and I had to deal with her constant bragging. “My camera is better than yours” “mine is more expensive” “mine has this... has that” keep in mind that she also is not able to afford it at all and didn’t need a new phone. She purely did it to be in competition with me and now she’s struggling to pay it. Everyday she HAS to tell me that her phone is better than mine and me shrugging her off seems to annoy her. I feel bad that she put herself into that situation, it’s a mental illness and she can’t control it due to her upbringing... I’m more sad than annoyed for her.

I already unlocked the old capes on my old iphone 5 with my xbox account, but for some reason i can't see the capes on my new android phone with the same xbox account. Can anyone help me with this problem?
I can't wait to use this browser but it has a major bug. The browser is constantly requesting location services even when not needed. Only solution is deny access. This happens to me in iOS 13.1.1 Iphone XR. I'm not sure yet, but I think this is a behavior also seen in the Bing App, so non of them are usable to me. Any fix for this?
I cracked my AW screen after tripping at work today. I’m going to take it to Apple tomorrow and have them fix it (I have AppleCare+) but I’m really worried about potentially getting a refurbished watch. I’ve had a refurbished iPhone before and it was terrible (slow, glitch, stopped working after a few months). What should I expect? Can they just replace my screen at the store? I’m hoping to get this done quickly because I’m seeing my grandmother for Thanksgiving and she bought the AW for me earlier this year as a birthday present and I would feel awful if she knew I had been so careless :(
TL;DR can a GPS only Series 3 map routes out on Runtastic/Adidas running

Hi all, 

Looking at getting an Apple Watch, probably just a series3, purely for the purpose of tracking my runs and being able to ditch the iPhone 7 for the run.
It will not be my daily watch.

I would be sticking with a GPS only as my phone carrier(Koodo in Canada) does not support Data Share and would need it’s own sim/phone number. 
Changing carrier is not an option.

I would be using Runtastic (Now Adidas Running) but want to check from other users if I can still get GPS Trace on the GPS only model?

Other features i wouldn’t mind confirmation of based on others experience: 

- Bluetooth connection for music streaming to Bose Soundsport wireless

- offline Spotify/music storage and playback. I understand I won’t get streaming, being non-cell but if I can fit a 100-200 song playlist on its 8gb memory that would tie me over.

- HRM feedback for Runtastic

Anyone able to comment, more specifically on the GPS tracing?

My game has recently been crashing constantly after the new iOS update. I don’t know if it was the iOS update that caused it or if it’s something else. I already sent a big report to epic, I just wanted to see if some people have the same problem as me. I play on iPhone XR with lowest settings
Hi im a 17 years old, I got a Iphone but I want to get off the internet. But a phone is now necessary and I would prefer a phone with a easy text option, like "BlackBerry" keyboard device. I also have Spotify and I don’t know if I can access it from a flip phone. (Understand that I am new in this game and my first language is not English)
So I work with people with intillectual disabilities. I.e. impulse control, schizophrenia etc. One of my individuals has family link to monitor thier phone for this reason. He has recently been transferred to another area where I no longer work with him, but his new manager  has an iPhone. Is it possible to use family link with the phone? Or is there an equivalent they can use that is iPhone friendly? the individual has an Android phone

This was my first and only android phone, and sadly it will be my last. It had everything: great camera, amazing display, great UI. I just decided that i need my phone to work and i need it to be updated. I crave new features, and this phone most likely not getting upgraded to android 10 makes my journey sadly come to an end. I’m switching to an iPhone 8+ and yes i’m aware it’s worse than the S8 in every way except power. I wish you all the best. It’s been incredibly fun 😀

Anyone switch from Sprint to Metro? What has been your experience? I am eyeing the $60 plan for 4 lines total $120. Thoughts. Thinking of Byop our iphone 6s and 7.
This is actually fucking annoying since this happened with tuber simulator. IPhone 6, write in my username loads to island then cuts to black and crashes. Deleted the game, reinstalled it wrote a new username crashes again. Any solutions to this bullshit?

Anyone else?
I always respected the cool downs. Nothing super speed out of the ordinary. 
Should I just not use iPogo and use something else?

Accidentally deleted a old iMessage thread from my deceased dad... ANY way to undo this and get it all back?!?
I know that this is a huge problem with iPhones that everyone who wants to change their ringtone experiences, but I can’t find a tutorial on how to do it anywhere, and I’ve been searching for an hour! I would like to do it for free but everything requires garage band (which isn’t)! If anyone could help me out by maybe sending a link to a tutorial or simply writing out some rough instructions it would be much appreciated
I’m visiting my parents who only have an Apple TV 2. I wanted to watch the new episode of See so I attempted to AirPlay it from my iPhone and I keep getting the Error Loading Content message.  
  
I tried AirPlaying a movie through the Prime Video app and it worked flawlessly. Is AppleTV+ content blocked from AirPlaying to an ‘obsolete’ Apple TV?
So, I know that the iPhone 11 Pro/Pro Max come with USB-C to Lightning cables for fast charging and the regular iPhone 11 supports them. Regular Lightning supports HDMI output, so I was wondering if the USB-C to Lightning cable does, too. If I were to plug the phone and cable into a USB-C hub, would the HDMI work? Also, (and mainly why I’m asking) if I were to plug the cable and phone into a USB-C monitor, would that work?
Just received the new generation OBDEleven device in the mail.  Used my iPhone for the apps and so far so good.  Long coding is not currently supported with the pro version FYI but I don’t really know how to use the feature with out reading more online anyways.  Only thing I wasn’t able to use was the “lane assist warning” app feature.  I keep getting a message “check ignition and try again”.  I’ve tried it with battery only on and with the engine running and get the same error message.
I am loving my S10+. This is my first true flagship phone. My previous phone was an LG G5, a trash can:). GPS wasn't working, phone was bootlooping almost every day,screen retention, battery SOT about 1h and 30 minutes... but now... jumping to this mad lad, the S10+ is a beast. GPS is instantenous, battery SOT about 5-6 hours. Going from a G5 to this is a huge change. 

This is basically my first true flagship phone and it is brilliant. My friends were telling me to get an iPhone XR but now that I have the S10+ I could never go to an iPhone XR... seems like a downgrade 🤔

Any tips for such a great phone? :)

Also, if you're reading this hope you're having a great day!
Should i buy iphone 11 or 11 pro max?
I'm planning on these 2 phone because the 11pro is too small for me

11 : nice phone but i'm afraid in the future i feel that the 11's screen is too small for me and the phone has lcd screen i'm afraid i ended hate the lcd screen. The main issue is the battery, color and the size though (the pro's color is better imo). i'm using s8 now and i feel like the screen is too small.

11 pro max : pretty great display and battery, but pricier than the 11, it's pretty good for reading books and documents, and i really love the grey color of the pro series. I usually use ipad for reading ebooks on school but the 11pro max is pretty nice when i don't bring my laptop or ipad.

I'm planning for using this for for 4-5  years or maybe till it's broken so screen size and battery is improtant for me.

My MBP's Siri is in English but I want to change my iPhone's Siri to Japanese, however, every time I change my iPhone's Siri from English to Japanese, the language on my MBP's Siri also changes and whenever I change it back to English my iPhone's Siri changes back to English as well.
TLDR: The numbers tied to my prime account for 2FA are US numbers (not my numbers anymore), so I cannot log in. Every time I try it asks me to text my old US number, or to send a push verification to my iPhone's app (which for some reason isn't working either). Not sure what to do since I cannot contact Amazon without apparently being logged into the account.

Any ideas?
I recently switched from an iPhone 7+ to the Pixel 4 XL. My photos transferred fine, but the metadata - notably locations - were stripped from them during the transfer. Is there any way to transfer that information as well?
Just got the new iphone. 

Wondering how long should i charge it for before start using it. 

I read somewhere you need 3++ hours but the article’s pretty old (iphone 4 old) not sure if things are still applicable to 11.

So anyways, any advice is appreciated. :)

Ok I know this should go on the stepparents forum but people there can sometimes get judgy and in their feelings over real life shit. 

I’m gonna shorten this as much as possible. And sorry if it’s all over the place but I’m fuming and confused all at the same time. BTW I know I used Disney Dad and know that it’s a term reserved for non custodial dads but he’s like a FULL TIME Disney Dad. 

SD12 has gone from a nice girl with badass grades with a mild mannered demeanor to a demon preteen in a span of a few months. 

First incident (about a month ago), she had trash all over her room when my husband had me search for candy fundraiser $ that she had possibly lost in that bottomless pit. Didn’t find the money but found a bunch of garbage. Told me to leave it on the floor and when she got home from school, she knew what was up. I asked her about the squirrel stashing and she got angry and balled her fists at me as I was TALKING to her. Made a bad move and told her “don’t ever ball your fists unless you intend to use them and I’m NOT THE ONE.” Called husband and was pissed. He came home and took her for a drive, she embellished the fuck out of what actually happened (added some fluff and cried about how I don’t like her etc). To summarize, he took her side and ostracized me for an entire weekend.

Mid week, was cleaning and found a stack of letters to a boy (her phone is monitored by some Verizon kid spying shit her dad has so I’m sure she took it analog with the pen and paper to fly under the radar). Shit was inappropriate as hell so I gave them to him and he “handled it.” Not sure how but supposedly he did. My 9yo bio has the room next door and said there was a bunch of yelling. 

Friday, report cards came home. Her phone was being held hostage by dad Thursday night and he was going through the messages probably until 1am. I was off Friday and husband was already gone by 6:15 and SD12 takes off to the bus stop at 7:10. I had an alarm set for 7:30 and she was still here and knocked on my bedroom door asking if she could have her phone. I wasn’t sure of the situation so I said, “if your dad don’t give it to you, IDK what to say but I haven’t gotten a text to give it to you so go to the bus stop before you’re late.”

She was given an iPhone 8 for her 12th birthday back in May. She isn’t allowed full access unless it’s the weekend. During the week, it stays plugged in in the living room on an end table. The deal between them was straight As or a high B on report cards (not progress reports). If she didn’t keep her end of the deal, the phone would get taken away until the next report card, of course, if the grades improve. 

The phone got taken away due to not only the grades but a slew of inappropriate texts with boys and colorful language all up in there. “My stepmom is a fucking bitch, my dad made me watch my annoying ass baby sister (age: almost 2) for 15 minutes and it felt like a motherfucking eternity, I swear I’m treated like Cinderella in this house and my fav: I’m gonna beat my stepmom’s ass if she ever gets in my face again the way she did.” 

Homegirl’s chores are basic: wash your own clothes once a week cuz I am NOT dealing with period stained underwear and dirty gym clothes that can stand on their own, taking the trash out, scooping up THEIR german shepherd’s backyard cinnamon rolls, feed the dog and after dinner, both girls handle the dishes. Cinderella HOW? I sweep/mop/dust every single day for her to track mud all over the place. Sunday we deep clean bathrooms and all areas. BD9 and I share a bathroom and SD12 and my husband share another.  She’s responsible for cleaning theirs. She gets an allowance for the chores too 😒

How it went down Fri evening: The girls were hanging out and my husband asked my BD9 to go to her room and close the door. My ex husband was already on the way to pick her up for the weekend anyway. When BD9 got home she filled me in on what went down (because she’s nosy) and said that my husband made SD write some essay and was yelling at her about making dumb choices and something or other. She also mentioned that SD12 has cussed her out before. I’ll deal with that after the smoke clears from this one. 

Today, my husband went over the top. I think it was guilt. She’s like so lost not tethered to that phone so I felt he was trying to overcompensate. He was in her room watching movies with her ALLLL DAY and teaching her how to play poker. Basically spending an entire day entertaining her while I did some studying and holed up in my room. 

She’s leaving Wednesday to fly out to her moms for Thanksgiving. The school let out on Friday and they have this upcoming week off. Mom opted for the day before. My husband was talking about giving it back to her and I was like “If 12 year old me got my phone taken away until the next grading cycle was done, but got it back for 4 days, you didn’t follow through, you weren’t serious and I’ll exploit the shit out of that in the future.”


So here’s the question: What do y’all think devoting the entire day to her was about????
Feeling bad he took the phone away so he felt the need to entertain her all day? Trying to gauge if she’s mad at him for basically calling her out on her shit and dishing a consequence?! We got her during the school year due to mom basically saying “we can’t take care of her because of the new baby” (this was when SD was 10). 

When I was her age, I would get in trouble and my dad would still be mad at me the next day. But today went as if nothing happened at all. I’m perplexed. 

But you know, he’s never home when issues arise. He works until 6pm and I log way more time with his daughter than he does. But since she added fake fluff to the first story, I’ve taken a step back in my interactions with her. She’s also really jealous (even though they get more one on one time than I do with him). She gets upset when we go on these halfass date nights like once every couple of months (always the movies). We never even have kidless dinners anymore because she’ll text him asking if we’re on the way home yet (30 mins after leaving the house) so “date nights” are always damn movies and rush back to her sulking...and him offering to make it up to her the next day. 

...I’m not looking forward to the years ahead...


The home button works fine and the fingerprint too. But it doesn’t have haptic again. Im on iOS 13.2 Iphone 7 so it feels weird. Any suggestions?
TL;DR can a GPS only Series 3 map routes out on Runtastic/Adidas running

Hi all, 

Looking at getting an Apple Watch, probably just a series3, purely for the purpose of tracking my runs and being able to ditch the iPhone 7 for the run.
It will not be my daily watch.

I would be sticking with a GPS only as my phone carrier(Koodo in Canada) does not support Data Share and would need it’s own sim/phone number. 
Changing carrier is not an option.

I would be using Runtastic (Now Adidas Running) but want to check from other users if I can still get GPS Trace on the GPS only model?

Other features i wouldn’t mind confirmation of based on others experience: 

- Bluetooth connection for music streaming to Bose Soundsport wireless

- offline Spotify/music storage and playback. I understand I won’t get streaming, being non-cell but if I can fit a 100-200 song playlist on its 8gb memory that would tie me over.

- HRM feedback for Runtastic

Anyone able to comment, more specifically on the GPS tracing?
Does anyone remember if they put any of them on sale last year? I know they did for Christmas.




Just got my first apple watch today.  My iPhone 8 is a company phone from my employer and I get company emails on it, but use a separate Gmail app to get to my personal email.

The watch lets me check my company email, but there doesn't seem to be a gmail app for it.  I saw some guides online on how to get gmail email notifications sent to the watch, but some of the comments in the videos say this method of doing it would only work on older versions of software on the watch...

Is there anyway to check both emails on this watch?


Hello! I was curious what is wrong with the TP buying system right now? I have an iPhone operating system, and for awhile now I haven’t been able to purchase TP through the app OR through the website. Any idea what could possibly be going on? I tried redownloading the app without any success.

Anyone use this yet? Would love to have both my work and personal lines on my iPhone 11.

After i updated my iPhone 7 to the newest iOS update, it completely froze with the screen on for about an hour and i had to force reset it. Since then it’s unable to get service because it says i need to update my phone, but my phone is up to date. My videos also no longer work on any app or even the iPhone camera. Anyone know how to fix this?
I log in then it says authentication required. It gives me two options: push button notification which will say “oops something went wrong” or just stay on the loading screen

The other option is a text message code which never sends even if I tell it to resend
I'm not colorblind, but I think it would be great to experience life from your \[colorblind\] perspective: buy clothes, go to the grocery store, watch movies, do graphic design; everything as a colorblind, and feel what it feels like to be colorblind to understand you better, and create colorblind-friendly software products, apps and designs in a future. I've been very obsessed with color vision deficiency lately, since I discovered two of my friends were colorblind. It's hard for me to imagine how it is like to not see all the colors and never have experienced them, especially since I enjoy colors a lot, and find them an important part of my life.

I was trying Visolve in my Mac with Sim Daltonism on my iPhone some minutes ago, to see how Visolve can help distinguish colors and I was surprised by how it works (basically by making some colors grayish). It would also be great to try a pair of EnChroma glasses over a pair of DeChroma glasses to see how much they help and why people cry when they try them for the first time.

*P.S. I found those glasses:* [*www.variantor.com*](https://www.variantor.com)*, but they're very expensive: $400 USD.*


I want a VPN for my iPhone preferably a free one but if there aren’t, I’ll pay. Just wanna make sure I don’t get my card information etc stolen with a weird dodgy VPN.

Perfect condition, works perfectly fine and has no external or internal hardware issues.

Looking for around $160

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: TITLE IS WRONG ITS A IPHONE 7
Hi all. After a few hours of browsing threads and the Internet I'm still hella confused. Please bear with me. 

First off, I just paid off my iPhone 8 Plus. I'm on a 2-line phone plan with my mom; pretty sure it's Unlimited, on auto-pay, and totals around \~$180 a month. 

I'm looking to upgrade to the iPhone 11 Pro Max, 64GB. I'm heavily entrenched in the Apple ecosystem. I'm looking to take on a yearly upgrade program because I do like keeping up with newer models (though I don't mind a few months between when I can switch and when a new phone releases, because I'm not wild about dealing with pre-orders and this gives me some buffer time to see if the release is something I really want to get or if I will be happy to stick with what I have, which has been the case with my 8 Plus up until now). 

1. Wary of the Hard inquiry with the Apple Upgrade Program, especially considering I can't get a solid answer on if every year it's another HI or not--I've seen mixed reports. I've been working to collect some credit cards early on to build my credit in the long run, so I'd prefer to avoid another HI. Not worth it. 
2. I'm going to take up part of the monthly phone bill soon to help my mom out a bit
3. We don't use a lot of the data on our plan; we've got around \~70% left for this cycle, even with my medium usage of Pokemon Go, checking emails on the go, and social media browsing, though I try to stick with WiFi as often as I can. She uses, probably, even less. 
4. She's considering switching to a lower plan. Any suggestions there would be great. 
5. I've never really noticed much lag except in some more congested areas; but beyond that I'm satisfied with our service, and she is, too. We've been with Verizon for years. 

Because I will be taking on some of the phone bill soon enough, I'm seriously considering taking on my own plan, especially if she decides NOT to downgrade. I think we are overpaying for what we use (or lack thereof). However, I'd like to keep my number, and I'd prefer to upgrade my phone first and work with her to find a better plan for us both. 

How exactly does Verizon's iPhone Upgrade Program work if we have an existing plan and an iPhone that is currently paid off? Is it a loan similar to Apple's program, and if so, is there a HI involved, or perhaps a soft inquiry? 

I know with Black Friday upcoming a lot of deals will be popping up, but I'm not too enthusiastic about dealing with anything around that time; also won't be doing any BOGO or whatnot, because she's got her Android and is happy with it/still paying it off. We don't have any reason/other people to add for another line. I'm also in that category of not being able to just buy a phone retail price/paying for it all at once, but still able to afford the luxury over time. So I don't believe I can do a prepaid plan. 

I guess I just need clarification on how Verizon's plan works with my current situation, and some help figuring out which plan(s) would be best for both of us/us individually, if I decide to take on my own plan. 

Thanks in advance for any and all advice; I'm new to all of this and my mom has some difficulty navigating everything as well.

Hey hello,

I made a post about requesting an iOS 13 version of Relocate (nepetas tweak).

however, someone on that post informed me it was working on two of the devices hes running checkra1!n and is able to run the tweak and open settings. Would anyone have any clue as to why it crashes?

my device is an iPhone 8, on 13.2.2 using checkra1n as my jailbreak.

I have tried reinstalling, uninstalling, and looking in Filza to delete a file but it was not there. Anything helps, this is the only location faker that is decent and doesn’t require a BS payment.
Of course, there are still 5.5 weeks left of 2019. However, it is 10:30 pm on a Saturday night, which means that I'm bored and couldn't post on r/r4r like I normally do because I blocked that subreddit. I don't think too much will change between now and 2020. That is why I write this now. Also, I was thinking of creating a blog site. That will have to be put on hold until I have more free time to make content that will make the monthly fee feel worth it to me. My YouTube channel used to be the outlet for my thoughts until my sister found it and my dad told me to make it more private due to the fact that I'm going to be a high school teacher in 4-5 months. I consider this post as what I would have written first on that blog site. 

This year is a combination of things I did for the present me and things I did for possibly the future me. I do think that 2020 will still be more important than this year since it is when I will be student teaching to become a high school teacher for the fall. But those who know me know that 2019 was momentous for me. 

It was a year of changes. The changes I will discuss are not in chronological order, they are just the ones that I thought of first: 

-I quit caffeine back in late March. I have only drunk caffeine 2-3 times since then. That saves me a lot of money and I feel like it has had health benefits. I'm not as anxious as I used to be and I don't have any afternoon crashes. 

-I quit video games back in April. There were a lot of reasons for doing that. However, this is one of the self-improvements that I feel I may fall back on.  Today for some reason I've had a strong urge to just play for a month between when I turn in my last fall grad school class assignment this Tuesday until I start student teaching in early January. We'll see what happens there. All I know is that I haven't felt angry like I was when I would sometimes play video games. Also, not playing them, not going on video game subreddits, not watching video game YouTube channels, and not going on Twitch has saved me a lot of time. You will notice that a lot of these changes were to save time that I needed for other areas.

-I quit a lot of social media apps and websites. This was due to my work crush being on a lot of them and then in mid-July finding out that she was seeing a guy. I need to take some time to discuss that since it was a big part of my year. I have had a crush on her for too long, ever since we started to work in the same classroom in February 2018. Who knows if she was ever into me or not. We had had great chemistry, but I never wanted to make things awkward by asking her out when no one at the school dated each other. I think I was just surprised in July when she said that since we were having long Snapchat conversations about personal stuff between March and July. I helped in the special needs classroom about 5-6 times in October and early November. Interacting with her there didn't push me either way too much. But due to how work is, I will now not be able to help in the special needs classroom until April. I'm hoping that I completely get over her by then. Let's get back to the social media aspect. She and I follow each other on Instagram, so I quit that along with Snapchat pretty quickly. I also quit Facebook and Messenger. Twitter was the social media website that I was pretty much off of before the summer started. All of those actions have saved me a lot of time. I think it's probably also helped me mentally since I don't have to try to prove myself to the world and also I don't have to see other people try to prove themselves. I was off of Reddit for a lot of the summer as well. People reaching out pulled me back in and I have enjoyed those conversations. I now see the silver lining in finding out that my crush was seeing someone. It helped me decide to quit those websites. I had been trying for so long, it felt like self-improvement that I couldn't get around to doing. In fact, I kept telling myself before July to "imagine that you open up Instagram one day and you see her with her boyfriend". I had to finally believe it to change my ways. I realize how much privacy I have nowadays. I could be doing anything and no one would really know besides people I tell. Back when I was heavy into social media I always documented where I was. I think it also helps that I haven't posted on Reddit as often. It's a social media where I wasn't having a lot of success with. You can notice that I don't post on r/r4r that much. That subreddit used to give me success, but not really anymore. 

-I took a break from chess. This was back in late July. The only chess-related activities I've done is that I've played for my local chess team twice against other local chess teams. I didn't want to tell my captain that I couldn't play because I don't want to lose those friendships. I took the break because it was a mismatch between expectations and reality. I learned about a happiness equation this year: happiness equals reality minus expectations. You either need to have a great reality, which you can't control, or you lower your expectations to increase happiness. My chess expectations were super high after months and months of intense practice. I made 98% of my YT video private, but I know that there are dozens of videos of me training on my chess. The last tournament I was in was going well. I was 2-0-1 and going into the last day feeling good. I just needed a win and a draw or 2 wins to earn a lot of prize money. I ended up losing both of those Sunday matches. My rating only went down 14 points, but I felt like I was continuing the plateau that had started two years ago. So, I decided to take a break. I'll get back into it in the spring when I have more time. Playing for the chess team this fall has reminded me why I love chess. When I win, which is what I've done twice this season, it feels great. The problem is that the losses feel even worse in the reverse direction.  I know that I'll need to change my mindset. I also want to save money from not traveling and entering tourneys to hire my chess friend who is a really strong coach. He'll probably cost like $40-$50 an hour.

-I changed my ways on my phone and laptop. On Chrome I now limit myself to 10 minutes a day on GroupMe and ESPN fantasy football. The limit doesn't happen on Tuesdays or Sundays, however. On Tuesdays I have to pick up free agent fantasy players and on Sundays I like to sometimes see my matchup score as well as text with my friends more. I had deleted the GroupMe app off of my phone, as well as Safari and Mail. That saves me so much time that these past weeks I've been averaging 30 minutes a day on my phone. That has helped a lot in terms of how busy I've been with other things. 

-Besides family dinners (since I moved back into my parents' in July due to grad school being expensive and student teaching not being paid for 3 months) as of yesterday I have gone vegan. I think that it's mostly due to climate change factors. I also want to see if I would be able to do it. I was vegetarian when I would eat by myself when I lived in a condo with my friend. I went back to eating meat with my family and there have been many days where my stomach hasn't felt exactly right. I'm hoping that I'll feel better when I'm a vegan for most of the day. 

-I set myself up for future career success. I have worked really hard in this fall grad school class, which is the 2nd to last class that I need to become licensed. It's probably been about 100 hours of work outside of class within the last 10-11 weeks. I've written around 55,000 words in all of the documents I've had to write. Also, our huge project was something I turned in two days ago. That contained 31 attachments! Over the summer I took a Google for Education class to become certified in the Google for Education products. I took the online certification exam in September and passed. I think that will look good on my resume. I also landed a student teaching spot back in late June. I'll be student teaching there starting in January. I'm hoping that I can finish grad school strong and be ready for my next chapter in life: moving out into my own place, most likely in a new town, and being a high school teacher. Plus, over the summer I was a science camp counselor for 1st and 2nd graders.  I think that was a great experience because I learned a lot about teaching and about how to teach science. Finally, I'm currently a long-term substitute for a middle school gifted math teacher. I've been learning how to plan lessons for different classes, plus in early December I'll have to participate in parent-teacher conferences, which is something I've never done before. 

-I quit a side tutoring job that wasn't beneficial to me. It was through a private company and the pay wasn't good and I usually had to drive a lot of miles some of the days of the week to meet the students at their homes. If I go back into tutoring it will be on my own terms without the use of a company finding me availabilities. 

-I started reading books again. I've probably read around 10 books for fun ever since the spring. That isn't that much. I blame my busy summer camp and then my busy substitute job + grad school class this fall. I now have stockpiled this list of books that I want to read eventually.

-I also made the switch to Google Calendar back in mid-August. I had learned about its benefits through the Google for Education class. I still use it every day and I feel like it's helped me a lot. Before, the way I organized things was through Reminder on my iPhone + multiple word documents on my laptop that were to-do lists + a physical monthly calendar + a notebook with some things.  Now, most of those things are inside Google Calendar.

-I finally got out of the cycle of downloading dating apps -&gt; deleting them -&gt; downloading them again. I realized logically that I just have barely any success on them. I went on my first ever date through Bumble, back in late April/early May. However, that was after 3 years of slaving away at them. I got stood up on a Tinder date in June and realized that dating apps weren't right for me. I went back on them in August and I believe early October. But nowadays I have no need to re-download them again. I think at this point I know that I just need to be super social when I'm living on my own. I think living on my own will kick me into being more sociable with others around me and to seek out other people. Quitting dating apps was another reason why my daily phone screen time has been down a lot than what it used to be (1.5-2 hours). 

Overall, there have been a lot of changes in my life, most of them for the better. I know that 2020 will bring a lot of changes as well. 2019 sets me up for success based on the habits that I'm forming now. I'm forming habits in what I do on the internet and on my phone, my diet, my future career, my social life, and my intellectual pursuits. I'm hoping that they will turn out to be the correct decisions that I have made when I look back at this period of my life. Of course, it's hard to judge if these things will be the causes of future things or if these things were the best things for me to do with my time. I also don't know if anyone will see this blog and care. It's kind of like my YouTube channel, which had 13 subscribers. When I would record myself there it was mostly for me. When I express these things it helps me remember what I've been doing with my time. I think it also makes me feel good when I can talk about a lot of positive changes in my life. If you've somehow gotten all the way through this and made it to the end, reach out to me. Although I don't think anyone will really read this except maybe for the people who I already talk to daily or weekly. Well, this has been the first blog post that would have gone on my blog, probably named vintagegeo.com. Until next time
So yeah I have an iPhone and I noticed I have the ability to cast to my Google home speakers. If I get chromecast will it cast the video to my tv?
I have an iPhone 7 which is roughly a year and a half old and it has a swollen battery. Just wondering if an authorised repairer would fix it or would they refuse?

Thanks in advance
Hi! I have an iPhone XR, it has the latest update, but this problem is there for a while. The app store doesn’t load at all when I’m on 4G.

When I use Wifi it works, when I switch to 3G it works, but never on 4G, even though 4G is working fine on all the other apps.

I found some people at apple online support with the same issue, but no one seemed to get a solution there...

Any ideas?

thanks for reading.
How long would it take a 50 Watt solar panel to charge a 2,675mAh (Same size as iPhone 8 plus) portable battery?  Also, what factors could affect this conversion? Thanks in advance!
I am getting a deal on iPhone X for $500, never used out of the box. And under warranty till September 2020. 
Should I get it?

Is it possible to 3d touch (long press) tick sound from iphone ios 13 to ipad ios 13 ?
It's an iPhone 6, latest iOS. After attempting to take a picture, the screen turned entirely one color, a sort of tan-ish orange-ish. It went black after that and won't boot at all, including a force boot. Holding both buttons as is the intended force-boot method produces no response whatsoever, and the device isn't showing up in iTunes either, making conventional solutions like a factory reset impossible.
Using iOS 13 on an iPhone 11 Pro Max and a Xbox one wireless controller. I can play one match and then when I try to play a second match, the controller doesn’t work till I force close and reopen the all
It's not even consistent about what induces the constant crashing. On some iPhones and iPads running iOS versions 12.4, 13.2.2, and 13.2.3 it hangs during initial startup. Other times the game will run for 2 - 30 seconds before crashing. And sometimes it'll just work fine. Nothing has changed, it just seems to decide it wants to run. Looking at the crash logs isn't too helpful, since there's nothing interacting with the game process to mess it up. There are three threads that are prone to dying randomly on jailbroken devices.

Thread 3 - Graphics Thread
Thread 9 - Audio Rendering and Processing Thread
Thread 11 - I/O and Internet Access

Whoever programmed this game clearly didn't make it work properly on anything other than a stock iOS state, though there's no code that leads be to believe it's intentional. It just wasn't programmed very well.



My coworker just gave me their old iPhone today and I'd like to put one of my data sims in it but I'm having trouble with getting the phone to connect, I've put the apn as w2g2 like it says to but I can't get it to work, any suggestions would help.
-Thanks


When I make or receive a call I can’t hear the other person, however they can hear me. I tried booting in safe mode and still no luck. I don’t have opener installed, and couldn’t find any other posts. Calls work just fine in non jb state. Sometimes the call will even fail. It’s not an issue with my provider. Thanks! Oh I’m on 12.1.3 iPhone XR
I have an 8KB .png image I want to move from my MacBook Pro to iPhone Xs, both on the latest updates. You'd think this would be simple but nothing is working. I had it stored in iCloud but when opening it through the files app it just says the file name without showing the image. Transferring via AirDrop is blowing up the image massively and ruining the quality. I even tried just emailing it but it's only coming up with an empty file that just says the name again. I just don't understand how it can be so hard to transfer one image...

For the past two years, at any given time 10-15 out of my 70 decora dimmers/switches would show up as "no response" on the Home App. The firmware updates did not offer much help either. The confusing part was that my router's page was showing that all the switches were indeed connected to the router. I followed the general advice by separating bands and that didn't make much of a difference. A couple weeks ago I decided to upgrade from the Tri-Band AC Velop 3-pack to a single AX Velop. Although my wireless speeds increase a bit, I still had issues. I read another post suggesting tweaking "airtime fairness" rules but that wasn't an option in the velop, so I got a Netgear Ax8 router and with a little tweak of the settings, Homekit runs perfectly, at the expense of some wifi speed. 

Settings:

\-Disable WMM on the 2.4Ghz: I believe this made all the difference! My 2.4Ghz speeds went down to single digits but I haven't had any problems since. Interestingly my wired speeds also went down from 900Mbps to 570Mbps. The speeds on the 5Ghz band on my iPhone 11 decreased from 500Mbps to around 320Mbps.

\-Separate 2.4 and 5Ghz 

\-2.4Ghz Channel on auto: I tired channel 1,6, and 11 and was still having multiple "no response" errors. Channel 1 was the worst with 30+ no response. 

\-Disable implicit beamforming

\-Disable MU-MIMO 

I'm not a networking expert, so I'm gonna assume this was sheer luck. I think the problem with the Leviton Homekit Dimmers is that they require a strong and continuous signal. Basically you need a very good router that can be "dumbed down". I wouldn't recommend doing this with a internet service that's less than 1Gbps because the 2.4GHz speeds may be less than 1Mbps and not work at all. The loss of speed is a bummer but to stream 4k you really only need 25-50Mbps and thats easily achievable on the 5Ghz band.

24f here. Excuse me if this is a dumb question. My boyfriend seems concerned that I can’t watch videos on an iPhone unless I’m holding it away from my face. If it’s about a foot in front of my face, I see horizontally double images and have to close one eye to fix it (doesn’t matter which one, but I generally close the left one because it’s easier). As I move the phone further away, it’s easier to see, but even when it’s not double, it still look clearer with one eye shut. I thought this happened to everyone, but my boyfriend said it doesn’t. Asked my siblings later on and they all agreed. I have glasses for very slight nearsightedness (I don’t actually know the prescription), but I rarely wear them except for at night or if I need to read something from across a room. Wondering if I should see an eye doc again.
Discussion about 2020 iphones


 

Hey I'm trying to jailbreak my iPhone 6s Plus (iPhone 8,2) on iOS 13.1.2 and after I go though all of the steps after I put my device into DFU Mode it starts the jailbreaking process and I get a error -28 and all it said was it was a exploit error, I'm using a offical apple lighting cable, the only problem I can think is that I am running on a hackintosh and only running high sierra (10.3.3) because I have a gtx 1060 6gb.  Any help would be great.

Trying to install alt store on a Mac to my iPhone and keep getting this error message: 'The data couldn’t be read because it isn’t in the correct format.'



Hello! So until a few days ago my girlfriend has been an iPhone user. She recently picked up a nice Galaxy S10. We wanted to transfer all her photos from the iPhone to the Android. I figured the best solution would be to upload the pics to the cloud and then download them. So they got uploaded to the Google cloud from her iPhone. We can see all of them (thousands of pics) on the android device now. This all worked perfectly.  

The question is simply: how on earth do we download everything to the gallery? She paid to increase cloud storage specifically to use it for this task and then remove it from cloud storage, and it is automatically UPLOADING from device to the cloud, so how do we "sync" the other direction?  

Her argument is that if she had just purchased a new iPhone, it would have been an extremely simple process, and her new phone would have been automatically populated with all her photos. Any help with this problem would be much appreciated as I've been searching and unable to find a true solution to this. Thanks in advance.
Hey all, I’m having some trouble with my cx5 lately. Earlier today I connected my iPhone and was using CarPlay with no issues (both using google maps and Spotify). But tonight, I plugged my phone in and the car would register that CarPlay was in use but the screen wouldn’t switch over to the CarPlay screen. I tried pressing all of the buttons on both the screen and on the center console. Nothing got it to switch over. The center console would still control the functions on my phone and my phone was still able to play music through the CarPlay. When I go to the entertainment screen, there would be a check next to CarPlay indicating that CarPlay was in use. I tried it with multiple phones with the same result. 

Sometimes when I was trying to fix the issue I would plug in the phone and the screen on the car will go completely black and won’t change from this, but I can still use the console node to change settings...even though i can’t see what I’m changing to/from. 

The other weird thing that I believe is related is that my backup camera stopped working at this exact same time. When I put the car in reverse, the screen will change and give me the warning to watch my surroundings, but the screen goes completely black. 

I’ve tried restarting the car multiple times but that doesn’t change anything. I’m wondering if it needs a full minute or two to reset the system.  I only shut it off for a few seconds before turning it back on.

Anyone have any issues with what’s going on? My phone could be updated so I’m going to try that next. But if that doesn’t fix it, has anything like this happened to anyone?

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!




My friend wants to purchase headphones that have good or reliable noise canceling, which are comfortable at the same time. Shes not really a redditor so i'll be asking on her behalf. She wants the headphones to sound good and have noise cancellation, and she wants to be able to wear it without being uncomfortable. She previously mentioned that she doesn't know about her buying beats as they are on ear and said that the Bose 700 are comfortable after trying them in a store. These are her current buying options.   


Beats Studio 3  
Beats Solo Pro  
[Sony 1000XM3](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-WH1000XM3/dp/B07G4MNFS1)  
Bose 700  
Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II  
Apple AirPod Pros  


The Sony headphones are linked to an amazon link not to be confused with the wireless earbuds.  


Source - Used for her iPhone X and her Macbook Pro  


How it will be used - All around the place, loud places like cafes, or as quiet places like libraries.  


If theres any questions I'll try to respond asap, If there are any recomendations please drop them in the comments and try to have a reasonable price range similar to these.  


Thank you!
Hi! I’m planning to upgrade to a 11 Pro Max. Ever since the start, I’ve been on small iPhones and when I was given the choice, I always went for the small iPhones ie. I was on the 6, 6S, 7, X and XS. Now I have relatively small hands (average Asian male) but I mostly use my phone for gaming (Vainglory, Apple Arcade, Dead Cells, etc), watching YouTube, movies and Anime series, and reading comics and books. Would the bigger size screen be really that good? Anyone who went from a regular size to a Plus/Pro sized iphone
The youtube app on my iphone is not working all its shows is a white square and when i click on it just shows a black screen and shoots me back to the home screen. i have tried deleting the app and than try redownload it but every time i wanna re download all it says its open and when i click open nothing happens and than when i turn the phone off completely then turn it on again the app magically appears again but again as a white square. Is there anyways to fix it?
One day this will be a funny story.  I (39F) was just informed today that ALL of my text messages were being sent to my daughters (15F) iPhone.  She of course shared this with my older daughter (20F) and my parents and now I’m out. 

I had a very long (slightly uncomfortable) conversation with my girls about polyamory.  They don’t get it but they don’t care either.  

My mom and dad just think I’m dating multiple people and while they don’t get it they don’t seem to have a problem with it.  I left it at that with my parents because, baby steps, and I’m not in a serious relationship with anyone yet.  

PSA: on an iPhone you can check the settings and make sure that your kids phones aren’t set to receive texts from your number.  We made an emergency visit to the apple store to get it fixed.
This morning I dropped my phone outside and it was stolen, a few hours later I was home and was gonna activate lost mode on find my iPhone on my other phone but once I opened it it said to sign into to my Apple ID I was confused but I signed in with the password but it said to unlock my phone I checked my other devices and all of their Apple IDs where blocked I tried calling my phone with someone else’s phone and it said my SIM card was removed can someone lock my Apple ID from a phone they stole with a password on it?
**Budget**
$250-350 with a hard cap at $500. 

**Source/Amp**
I’d like to move freely around my house, so I’d like to plug my hardware into my iPhone via an adapter or connect through Bluetooth.

**How will the gear be used**
I’m mainly using these as I walk around my house or going for the occasional hike. Noise isolation would be nice, but not needed necessarily! 

**Preferred tonal balance**
I’m a total bass-head. However, the music I listen to has tons of layers to it so I’d like to clearly hear those without worrying about the bass drowning it out.

**Preferred genres**
EDM is a broad genre but to sum it up: experimental, psychedelic, futurebass, etc.

Here is a playlist that I believe demonstrates the variety of [music](https://soundcloud.com/sam-vanhorn-383415200/sets/other-world) I plan on listening to.

**Past Gear**
Nothing significant really. I had a pair of Beats Solos when they first launched, I’m currently using the HyperX Cloud Alphas for both gaming and music.

**What aspect of your current listening experience would you like to improve?**
I’m looking for a more precise sound with heavier bass. The headphones I’m currently using are great for gaming but sub-par for music.
I just recently got a C9 and setup HomeKit. When trying to airplay from either my Mac or iPhone I can hear the audio but, can not see the video and the tv screen just becomes black. 

After a few seconds it shows the Airplay screen again while audio is still playing.

Has anyone experienced this? 

The TV is most up to date at the time of this post on version 04.70.12

Also on iOS 13.2.3

I (35f) am happily married to my wife (45f) of 5 years. My entire life I have fallen for women - head over heels, put them up on a pedestal kind of love. When I finally found one that truly loved me the same way - I married her! I love her very much and she is the most wonderful woman I have ever met. I don’t deserve her. 
Recently, I have crossed paths with someone (60f) who I had an instant connection with. She lives a few hours away and I’ve only ever seen her 3 times in person.  She is a family member of another friend of mine (30f). It’s a pretty complicated mess to be perfectly honest, but I simply cannot help the way I feel about her. I love her. 

The 2nd time we met, we exchanged numbers (she wanted to share workouts with me and be able to find me on the iPhone app Find My Friends, which was just cute and playful) and we have been texting back and forth for a couple months. It’s playful, I say sweet things to her, I like to make her laugh and feel good. I encourage her to work out and I try to see how she is doing every day. It’s not over the top, but I try to text her once a day - I have to stop myself from texting too much. It’s hard not to as I have genuine feelings for her. 

My gut says the feelings are mutual, I’m not sure to what extent for her. She recently told me she felt like she knew me so well when we met - and we both felt the instant connection. Maybe I am just out to lunch but I believe there is something there. And the sexual tension between us is THICK - even my own wife commented on it to me when we first met. It upset her, naturally. I admitted a connection but assured her I would never cheat (which I genuinely do not want to cheat and I don’t realistically think anything will ever happen even if we somehow had the chance).

She has been married for over 30 years and I know the husband has some narcissistic tendencies (this has been shared with me by the family member, I read about it and it’s awful to suffer from narcissistic abuse). It absolutely guts me to think that she is not being treated the way she deserves. She is truly beautiful inside and out. I sense that she is lonely - they don’t share the same bed and it’s clear he doesn’t really have much interest in her anymore - or at the very least there is emotional abuse happening. I feel that she is likely a shell of herself - I see so much in her and want to encourage her and make her feel good and valued.

Financially she is in no position to leave even if she wanted to - she has no pension and only has government income. She completely relies on him for financial support. 

I guess the advice I am looking for is - how do I support her as a friend? I care for her so deeply. We were an instant match when we met. She calls me her BFF. There is quite an age gap. But we have become very good, fast friends. I want more - I want a deeper connection with her, how do I break through? I want to help her. I worry that her husband or other family member will read our messages. I am pretty sure they have so it’s hard to help someone if their narc husband will read any good messages and turn them around to make her feel like crap and question what I am telling her.

To be honest, she occupies my mind most of the time and I am thinking of her far more than I should. I am suffering my own bit of anxiety. I have feelings for her but I just want a friendship with her. It’s a difficult balance. If she didn’t live far away, I do believe things would escalate quite quickly, so living far away I believe I can focus on friendship and move on from romantic feelings. I don’t want anyone to be hurt but ultimately I cannot stop myself from being a part of her life - as long as she lets me. 

If I had the money I would pay to get her out of there. Time to win the lottery!

Maybe I don’t need advice. I just needed to post this somewhere.

TL;DR I have romantic feelings for an older woman. We are both married. She doesn’t know how I feel but there’s an instant connection we’ve acknowledged. We’ve become fast friends. We don’t live close. She’s in a bad marriage and I want to help her. But I don’t want to cheat - I love my wife. How do I support my friend and move from romantic feelings to platonic? My heart hurts. 

Edit: I don’t want advice on how to cheat on my wife. I want advice on how to support this woman as a friend. To be clear. The feelings are just background and make it more complicated.

Note: Before crucifying me, please read through the comments as I work through all of these feelings. It is difficult. Complicated. I am hurting. I don’t want anyone else to be hurt either. The whole thing sucks.

“Repaired” my iPhone SE

Hello, 

I hope somewhere here is tech savvy and has done something like this before. I had a loose connection or something irritating when listening to music, so I replaced the headphone socket (including the charger etc) .

Turns out I did it, good job, music works. No loose connection. Now I tried to watch a YouTube video and realized all of my speaker sounds aren’t coming out. Including alarms. Anyone know if there is a cable connected really close to the part I replaced that might have slipped out? Or more likely that the speaker is now broken on account of a short. 

If someone knows what I likely did to cause this, I might reopen the phone tomorrow and try to carefully fix. If it’s broken I’ll order replacement and wait until it’s delivered. 

Thank you in advance!

So recently I sold an iPhone 5 with a cracked back on eBay. There were photos of the cracked back and in the description it mentioned this cracked back. A few days after being delivered, the buyer requested a return because the phones back was cracked. Should I just accept the return and lose about $10 on shipping?

Maybe someone can show me the error in my ways....

I'm shooting an instructional guitar video that needs to be synced with audio later (I'm recording the guitar direct through my comp with logic) and the variable frame rates are ruining my footage and causing a syncing nightmare!

Here's my settings:

iPhone 8plus  
Shooting in 3K Filmic Extreme  
24fps  
variable iso's (experimenting)  
1/48 shutter speed  
Flat color settings  
44.1khz sampling

&amp;#x200B;

The problem...

Every time I record a shot (\~15 - 30min) at 24fps, I transfer the footage to my comp via itunes, and the resulting footage is anywhere from 18 - 21fps and plays slow (just enough to be noticeable) and kinda choppy. 

I'm new to filming, and I understand that phones tend to change the fps to save on processing power--and I am also casting the screen to a tv via chromecast to use as a monitor, so I get how this could cause a potential drop in frame rates...

...but here's the weird thing I can't understand...

If I change and "mismatch" the recording/playback fps to something like 25/30/48/60fps record @ 24fps playback, I can film everything under the exact same settings and the resulting footage is a CONSISTENT 24fps....????

The resulting footage looks great--clean, clear, and smooth--BUT the app won't record the room audio because of the fps mismatch, so now I have no audio to help me sync manually in Final Cut Pro.

I'm so confused, this all seems so backwards. I would assume that shooting at a higher frame rate would worsen the issue, but instead it fixes it.

I've also tried using Handbrake to fix the variable fps, and while it does produce a consistent 24fps final product, it takes FOREVER to transcode, my computer becomes virtually useless while it's working, and in the end the video and audio recordings STILL don't match.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong! Please somebody help!!!

I'm just going to keep things simple, I'm a teenager from Michigan I'm facing 3 different charges because of a stupid fight.

here's the backstory, I come from a broken home, mother was an abusive drug addict(whos now in recovery and doing much better and my dad has been gone since I can remember. I grew up around 2 rival gangs and have always been torn by the two.

Recently in a class a kid behind me wouldn't stop making gay jokes (I'm bisexual) and where I'm from and the people who know me would see me as a bitch if I took that kind of disrespect so I didn't see the way out of a fight at that moment, I stood up and told him to swing then we agreed to meet at a gas station across the street from the school. We were there and I g checked him (tested how hood he was) then swung on me, it's easy to say "oh you could've just walked away" until you were in the situation. My boys were there and were his so there was really no escape or ability to run without looking like a bitch. after he missed his first swing I grabbed him and began punching directly to his face with as much speed and force that I could and I made contact every time. we both ended up on the ground exchanging blows back and forth before our school police officer came and put us both in cuffs. we got into the car and drove to the school, I haven't had any charges in this state so I didn't get charged on the spot. The police officer took us to his office before the principles office; in his office, he called our parents and since I really don't have "parents" he called my uncle who I stay with; my uncle is not the same type of person as me, to begin with, he's 60 some years old and has the mindset of a drill sergeant. On the other hand, I'm a teenage pothead who grew up in some of the worst neighborhoods in new york. I make music off a shitty iPhone and I have 2 friends with some common sense, and they're more like family. my uncle answered the phone, he and the school police officer had the same discussion they've had 3 times prior.  the other kid's parents didn't pick up. we got sent to the principles office and practically got a slap on the wrist by the school with lunch detention for a month, which only bothers me because lunch is the time I get to sell nicotine and weed to lower classmen. but if this gets sent to the prosecutor I'm facing up to 270 days. I'm royally fucked, and I don't know what to do.
Hello beautiful people! I have multiple burn ins that are noticeable (Status bar icons and swipe up bar). Would this be covered for a free replacement? I’ve bought the phone in May of 2018 from carrier. I already tried sending it to repair through carrier but it was there for a month and nothing was fixed so I asked to get it back. Thanks!
does anyone have this i cant find it anywhere on the web

So i’ve recently been seeing wallpaper threads and been rearranging my apps on my home screen (getting used to folders in docks) 

Do you have any specific custom folders? I’m just using Screenshots and Memes cause my photo folder is just an abyss of memes, sm screenshots, text screenshots &amp; saved pics of stuff i find on the internet

My main use for xcloud would be to just play in another room at home. I have an iPhone that I’d be running it on. 

With all the testing being android only and the rumors if it not being on iOS till full release which could be a while. Should I just go ahead and spend the $12 on Onecast? Does anyone know if that actually works well? Thanks!
So I have been using Express VPN on both my iPhone and my PC and in the beginning, it was working great on both devices at all times of day; but more recently, the VPN works great in the morning, but right when it gets dark out, the VPN on my PC becomes extremely slow and the VPN on my phone stops working altogether. Is this an issue with my VPN service, or the WiFi in this country itself blocking all VPNs? If its an issue with my VPN, what VPN (preferably free) would you guys consider I use, that has regularly been good and dependable for you?

Thanks in advance for your replies.
 

just so you guys know im paying for it im just letting him do it because he gets deals from his work on phone

18M so my dad say shit and does not do it for example i broke my phone about a month ago and my dad keeps telling me he gonna get me a new one tomorrow and he says sorry when he does not get me one and then he repeat it every single day i just been not caring and let him do him because he does not do thing right away

some of you will say he does not have time to get me a phone but he does at work he gos to the mall and buys me and my sibbs unwanted clothes most of the time even tho i told him to stop buying me clothes i got too much.

he kept saying the next day and the next day and the next day until yesterday he went and they told him he have too pay off my mom phone first before getting a new phone which is 450$ left and he said he gonna let my mom to sign a new phone contract to get a better deal even tho he is not paying

I'm leaving for a couple of days tomorrow morning to hang out with my friend up north and i would have liked to have my own phone i have my dad old phone which i cant download anything i just can watch youtube and call and he told me not too lose or break it because he have impotent things on it which is hard becasue its a easy to brake phone if he did't want to lose the things on their he should of got me a phone

he always does shit last min or not at all he just talk when he talks about business ideas we know he never gonna do them.

I told my mom to take me to Walmart to get a just a cheap phone because fuck it i just wanted a phone that i just can do whatever i want with it she talked me out of it and said i was being impatient and acting out of impulse and said i should just wait before i regretted it because if i buy a phone today my dad will not do a contract with me because he gonna say you have a good phone right here.

Im getting the iphone 11to compare

Who gets all my tomes?  I’m thinking Rhazin, but I wanted to confirm with the community before I botched it all up.

Edit: I can’t add flair... I’m on the iPhone web interface, sad day for me.

Edit Edit: I found a way!  UwU

I’ve seen some people be able to do it, but I can’t seem to find anything about how to do it online. Any help?
Note 10 256 GB with case. will include original charger and box. I want to trade for iPhone XS max, 11/pro, storage doesn't matter. have had it for around 2 months. I will be in Greenville until Tuesday and near Raleigh from Tuesday to Friday or Saturday.

Lots of photos and video clips on our phones   Doesn’t it make sense instead of adding an. Apple TV 4K with ridiculous high price of $250 (in Canada ) to our new 75” X900F, we change it with X950G which not only supports AirPlay 2 but also has X-wide angle technology. The price difference between the two solutions is about $250. ( Edited)
I have an archived backup for my iPhone from when it was on iOS 12. There are some documents I deleted a couple months ago that are impossible to recover, but I know they are on that iPhone archive in a scanner app. If I can just restore my iPhone back to iOS 12, I can recover the files.
I never had an iPhone and wanted to buy the 8 this december. But checking out review websites, I noticed that most cheaper androids have (in numbers) better camera, processor, resolution etc etc. What makes the iPhone 8 a better option? And will it receive updates/run well in 3-4 years?

Been refreshing this page, they finally posted it today but... is it just a copy of magenta friday this year?

Anyway, my mom wanted her first cell phone now that her verizon land line is static when it rains (and the techs they send never fix it). Great, I can finally take advantage of a deal because I'll be adding a line. Call my team of experts and am thanked for being such a loyal customer right off the bat (nearly 15 years). Said I wanted the iPhone 11 on us offer and the rep starts to add it, were 15 minutes into the call and she says its only for magenta plans. Really, you couldn't put that on the black Friday site?

I had to chat for a while, call my mom to ask what color phone she wanted first (since my expert said we were ready to add the new line and pick the phone).

I asked her what about the galaxy BOGO... no not qualified. What about the old ass iPhone 8... no not qualified, ok ok a shitty REVVLRY? Nope.

Now I see why they call it magenta friday, if you're not magenta they dont care no matter how much they thank you for being a loyal customer.

as the title suggests, i want to know how to get my recordings to my iphone or mac without uploading to youtube so i can edit them and upload that. 

that is what i need to know mostly but if you can i would also like to know how to set the recording resolution from 720p to at least 1080p. 

thanks
I saw an article saying yes but was not paying attention to the date. It was an older model and I don’t see a 3.5mm port. I bought an iPhone adapter since they don’t have headphone jack’s anymore. Any specific cord to make it work?

who knows where i can go to do this in the DTLA AREA?
As of a few days ago, I am unable to access my router settings using my Mac mini. I can access it through my iPhone and log in. I’ve rebooted it and it isn’t fixed. I haven’t done anything. Anyone else experience this
To start with, I am actually not that rich as what you think I might be. I do own several pieces of guccis and fendis and brands like that; I do not own a sport car because I can not drive, in fact I don’t think most of us would buy those. In my hometown my dad is going to buy a porsche in next spring, but in before we have been using the same old toyota for like 5 years. 
Yes I do drink bubble teas and use airpods pros and IPhoneX. 
An answer you click here to find: I personally do not like Chinese government but HK protesters are not peaceful at all. Peaceful people don’t throw petrol gases or burn random people alive or beat strangers passing by. I have equal disdain for those people and the ccp or more specifically winnie bear.  Also I don’t think I would ever ‘preach the truth of the Government’ because what you think is the truth might probably be not. 
I am bi-sexual and pro-feminism. Winnie bears idea contradicts mine.
I don’t really care about Taiwanese politics. If its people think it is a part of China, then it is; overwise it is not. It  has more strategic values for militaries because its geological location to China mainland; once it is completely independent, the us would 1000% interfere.
My weekly pocket money is around 500 dollars. But when it comes to luxuries I just use my parents cards lol.
I am a college student been outside  China for 4 years.
My parents are real estate business persons.
I knew a little about what is going on in XinJiang.
I like this country, but I don’t like its party or most of its actions and ideologies; I want to see my homeland better, but it is just so hard.
Oh yes, we rich international students do study. Have a due next 8 hours so its time for reddit lol

Anyone here with them? What’s the coverage like? Any complaints? Moving back to the city and want to pick up a new iPhone 11 on a plan. I’ve already crunched the numbers between Telus, Rogers (am on Bell) and Telus is 2nd to Freedom which is rock bottom. 

Freedom has terrible reviews of all the locations in town but then again people are nuts and I never visit a mobility store again after purchase because its 2019. 

I plan on watching for Black Friday deals this week before I make a decision but I was hoping for feedback. 

Thanks!

Around the same time I upgraded to the Apple Watch Series 5/watchOS 6 when they were released, I noticed the Apple Maps notifications on my watch no longer deep link into the Apple Maps app on my Apple Watch. I used to be able to tap on these notifications suggesting how long it will take me to get home or to work, etc., and the notification would deep link right into directions to that suggested destination. Now it's just a notification that I can't tap, only dismiss, and I have to manually pull up directions by locating and opening the Maps app. I also noticed it doesn't have the round Apple Watch Maps app icon anymore like it used to, it shows the square iPhone Apple Maps icon instead, indicating it's only a mirrored iPhone app notification and not available to be opened by an app installed on the watch itself.

Has anyone else seen this same behavior? I've unpaired and re-paired already, done reboots/force restarts of both watch and phone, and went as far as to uninstall and reinstall the Apple Maps app on my iPhone with no success. I'm currently waiting for a callback this coming Tuesday night from Apple on this issue; they sent it up to engineering to check on, since I did not have any options anywhere in the Watch Settings app regarding specifically mirroring Maps notifications to my watch from my iPhone. It's perplexing, and I miss the simplicity of just tapping on these convenient notifications for directions.

Hi! I’m trying to install my gmail account onto my iPhone 6s mail app, and the home screen to log in to google is in a different language... any ideas on why this is, and how I can change it back to English? The gmail app, google, and everything else on my phone is in English, the only issue is the initial screen to install gmail for my iPhone app... help!
The iPhone 6 can handle camera on single FaceTime calls, so is it possible to make a tweak that enables the camera in Group FaceTime calls on the iPhone 6 and below?

When I got got my shiny new iPhone 11 Max Pro from T-Mobe it was paid for in full and had no carrier obligation. Or so I thought.

On my iPhone xs I had taken advantage of the esim for my T-Mobile number and had a Sprint SIM card for my second number. I was looking forward to doing the same with the iPhone 11 Max Pro.  Turns out no matter whether you pay cash or finance they will not unlock the phone for 40 days.  Even if you've paid cash!

This really pisses me off and it sounds illegal. What basis do they have to tell me what I can do with a product that's fully paid for?  why should I have to wait 40 days to be able to switch to my new phone in the same configuration as my old phone?

Hope someone from Tmo reads the forums and addresses this absurd pain point.

Just purchased an 11 Pro Max online in India via Flipkart and out of the box, I noticed a tiny scratch on the phone's camera. The phone is not even an hour hold and hasn't even been even turned on it. What should I do? There's no official Apple store in the country and the website I purchased from does not refund/replace and instead askes to take it to an apple service centre. There's no way in hell I can live with this scratch or let them 'repair' my 1-hour old phone, what can I do? Anybody has an experience, will/do they replace phones with such faults?

I’m looking forward to but and iPhone 11 but people are saying the iPhone 11 screen is not that good, has the same ppi as the iPhone 4, and that the screen is not even 1080p. Is it really that bad?
I just bought an Apple Watch series 3 today and had to update to iOS 13 and jailbreak with checkra1n on my iPhone X. While a Watch Port hasn’t been done, I’m wondering if it’s possible to do a watch face port to give older Apple Watches all the new watch faces? I think this would be a great tweak and something I definitely would pay for!
