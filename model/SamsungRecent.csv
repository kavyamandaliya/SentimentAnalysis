Pbs is a great service regardless of the upcoming trial. But it's good to know it's free if you're interested. They also provide tons of educational and arts programming. PBS gave me amazing shows as a kid and continues to provide great content.
Not able to watch Disney+ on the Samsung App TV. Anyone else with this problem? I thought it was fixed.
I don't know what happened to Android Auto. In the last few weeks I've noticed that it gets super laggy to the point of a frozen phone screen (I use it on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10). It seems to coincide with some major update the app has been receiving. 

Playing music (YTM or GPM), with Google Maps navigation, and messages incoming every so often, used to be so smooth and flawless. 

Now, the opposite is true.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting angrier day by day, with my ryzen 2700x.I keep getting random freezes, that usually  are  5-10 secs or until i push task manager to get into it(at least  5 secs).I tried  to figure it out myself, but is getting over  my knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

At  first  i thought that maybe it might be  because of [windows.So](https://windows.So) i had to reinstall my windows , which i did but  with no point, as the freezes  are  still there. My freezes usually happen when i am using multiple instances of my game - GUILD wars 2, or  when i do work photoshop/revit /3d  related  stuff intensive one , and i got  lots  of chrome windows opened, + opera  etc.

I used  to have  an ASUS Crosshair VI Hero ,but it was  only 1 stick of 16gb then with it, but in the summer , somehow i managed to fry up my motherboard, at the point when my monitor fell over and pulled  down the power cable from the psu and the psu pulled the cable  from pci-e power slot or something like that.I don't know if something broke  but after that my mobo was  dead, and i had to buy a  new one.I never  expected to see that shit happening to one of the top mobo's , especially from asus.

As i needed  to buy something else, as  i  had  college exams at that time , in 3 days i got my hands on the  **MSi B450** [**Tomahawk**.](https://Tomahawk.It) It has/had no warranty  , as  i bought from something similar to ebay , but it was  branded like branded as   new, smelled like one, and didn't noticed  any problems  after  i installed, the price  was  right , the youtube reviews  were  good, so i  had  to go with the flow, especially after i payed  for that asus about 200$.The cinebench results  were  kinda the same ,about 1750 points , if not more than what crosshair had, as  i recall. 

I swapped  everything , in my windows power  plans, balanced , power , and  it still freezes.

I have  tried  to swap the settings to overclock/underclock the cpu , to have  a static overclock, everything that i was  able to google, youtube [etc.At](https://etc.At)  this I am not able to undervolt my cpu - with any milivolts, as  it will not  post  back into [bios.Im](https://bios.Im) also running on RAID 0 , so i tried  as much as  i could , but  i almost crapped  my pants like  2-3  times  when trying to overclock the timing on the memory.

What i can is  having a  static overclock on it , which i have  tried  but  after  a day i left  it back on stock, as  i was  afraid of what the safe voltages  are or not, and the freezing were  still there, but the speed  was  lower than on stock, so was  cinebench R15.I do stuff  on pc about 12  hours per day, at  least, so i  am just  tired of these  random freezes and i'm pretty close  to say MRRRRR  AMD  or MSI,  i thought  u guys had  safe  voltages, on stock or wtf  is going on.

AS  for my pc , i only  used  it on stock, all the  time. Whenever i tested something to see  what he can or cannot do , it was  mostly  done on the MSI [MOBO.My](https://MOBO.My) ryzen is exxactly 1  year  old this month. about 9 months  it  worked  with ASUS crosshair VI hero, until she crashed and burned  to hell, but even then it  was  freezing, but  at  that point i used  to believe  it was  related  to the 1  stick of 16gb  of DDR4 that i had. I wanted  to have  from start  32gb  , so when i heard  about AMD loving just  2 stick of ddr, i went with 32gb  of just  2 sticks.I actually  managed  to buy my other 16 gb  stick ,2 months ago or 3,  anyway it was  after  the MSI mobo.

&amp;#x200B;

I will put some pictures for desktop with settings.ALL the time i  had my pc running on stock , BUT This Time i wanted to make an exception, to see if it freezes / and with voltages  so high and speeds.  

The first  to pictures are with PBO enabled ,  and the voltages  are  sitting around 1.45 all the time , which really really  pisses  me off, as  i thought they  should go low, they should be average  and so on. but it doesn't swing down.With about 40 mins of  3 instances of gaming  which i  wasn't  in but kinda left  it run in the background, and typing this post on google chrome,you can see the results as for voltages , the speed  and everything that  the pc  wants. 

[Start of test,3 game instances, speeds voltages, etc,about 22 chrome windows opened.](https://preview.redd.it/t6ajca9yzcy31.jpg?width=2545&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d312837320138e85cbaf0496fe4e3d5cf3e9175f)

&amp;#x200B;

[about 40 mins in, same x3 GAmes, and the averages, when i was pretty much idle and typing this post  instead](https://preview.redd.it/mpgeqd730dy31.jpg?width=2516&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1baf29c80c8c36baaed736eb49b8819ad357f26d)

&amp;#x200B;

EVEN after  i close  the gaming  instances, the results and voltages  are  pretty much the same.

AFTer  15  mins of bios on stock,PBO is off- set  back to auto  or what he usually  has on defaults the naming. , core performance  pretty much off to auto  , these  are the results

&amp;#x200B;

[STOCK BIOS settings mobo](https://preview.redd.it/iinz9cnl0dy31.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43ffb016bd22ed91726783ec0eea8b99afb7079f)

So , i dunno  why is  everything so high on my settings, why is not lowering down the voltages, why are  they about 1.4 something when is just  chrome opened. Why do i keep getting  freezes, day by day . What more can i do to test  the [problem. At](https://problem.At)  this point i'm kinda resigned  to think that is most  likely CPU-MOBO problem, with a small chance of being RAM speed. RAMs  are  at  3200mhz  on stock , i couldn't tighten down the settings in bios on them, because they were either not posting , or because i can't find  any  videos or settings ,to use  on 2 stick of 32gb 3200 mhz ddr4. Becaue  of the twats  are  using only 16gb memories. 

PLS Help.


Please ... help :D I haven't slept for like a month trying to make my PC work as intended for 1500 EUR pc ...

**UPDATE6:** Adding some **CPU usages and latency screenshots during actual gaming** (ESO and AC:Origins as those are the only games on me atm after like 50th windows reinstall ...)  [https://prnt.sc/pw5g7e](https://prnt.sc/pw5g7e) \- latency,  [https://prnt.sc/pw5gcf](https://prnt.sc/pw5gcf) \- cpu usage during AC: Origins,  [https://prnt.sc/pw5gvi](https://prnt.sc/pw5gvi) \- cpu usage during AC: Origins (close up look on first 6 cores),  [https://prnt.sc/pw5h7o](https://prnt.sc/pw5h7o)  \- cpu usage while playing ESO ... I see lots of threads and latency (well all the latency) coming from system kernel ... Any ideas what it might be? I guess some drivers, but is there a way to get to know which? (already tried disabling all the usb I don't use, lan and audio card - and not just drivers, in bios even ...) .. **maybe chipset drivers suck?** Can't find newer than September ... forgot to make frametime screenshot, but it is a "rollercoaster" .. ms ingame jumping from 15ms all the way up to 100ms ...

**UPDATE5:** suddenly started getting **crackling sound on all devices** (monitor speakers, 2.1 logitech speakers and hyperx cloud 2 headset) when clicking on stuff, opening apps, changing volume etc... nothing except for some windows defender updates went through ....

**UPDATE4: tried using latencymon** instead of dpclat and these are the results! **terrible!** I browsed the net tho and did not find any solution ... :/ hopefully 1909 windows will fix this. I blame it on windows :D as I found several topics about 1903 causing stutters and freesync not working ... (**will try downgrading to 1809**) these are my findings (during 3dmark):  [https://prnt.sc/pvkodn](https://prnt.sc/pvkodn) ,  [https://prnt.sc/pvkohv](https://prnt.sc/pvkohv) Because now that I think about it my old PC was at 1803 even and all was smooth as hell ... **UPDATE:** todays 1909 update helped nothing unfortunately ...

The interrupt to process latency reflects the measured interval that a usermode process needed to respond to a hardware request from the moment the interrupt service routine started execution. This includes the scheduling and execution of a DPC routine, the signaling of an event and the waking up of a usermode thread from an idle wait state in response to that event.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hard pagefaults are events that get triggered by making use of virtual memory that is not resident in RAM but backed by a memory mapped file on disk. The process of resolving the hard pagefault requires reading in the memory from disk while the process is interrupted and blocked from execution.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: some processes were hit by hard pagefaults. If these were programs producing audio, they are likely to interrupt the audio stream resulting in dropouts, clicks and pops. Check the Processes tab to see which programs were hit.

**UPDATE3:** tried **Project Mercury** (simplified process lasso) to disable SMT conflict and jumping CCX. At first it gave me insane FPS boost! And I mean like 30% or more but did not fix the stutter. The next day it lowered FPS instead ... bamboozled ...

**UPDATE2:** all **synthetic benchmarks are running smooth** as hell, **GPU usage at 99%**, all looks good. Actually playing some **games** tho even when the **FPS is low, like 40FPS ... the GPU refuses to run at 99% ... it jumps between 30-70%**. It only keeps clock during benchmarks. It seems like all my **games are trying to to run on CPU and ignoring GPU ...**

**UPDATE1:** **latest ASUS bios** finally let me change **pci-e lanes to gen3, it did not help tho**. Everything is still super choppy. What still helps the most is using resolution scaling or VSR and setting ingame resolution to 8k even. For some reason it makes everything much smoother. Tried playing ESO for example and it is unplayable at my resolution. **At 8k it even gets more FPS and it looks much smoother LOL**... Some fps drops remain smooth even tho they are by 20, some fps drops cause micro freeze that you want to cry tho (so so working Freesync?)... still ... making the game run at 8k etc forces GPU to be at max usage so it lifts load from CPU and it becomes muuuuuch smoother. So either my ryzen **3600 is broken, or it's just crap CPU?** :D bottlenecking my GPU hard ... OR it's the ram ... because I have seen some ram comparisons and some ram had insane frametime spikes while at the same avarage FPS as some other rams being completely stable ... and frametime is my issue. It jumps by 100ms during stutters... **Asus bios version 2404 (agesa 1.0.0.4b)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What I tried so far according to comments: (ty so much for trying to help!)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Using 2 pci-e cables** \- 1 for 8 pin 1 for 6 pin - 0 improvement. Also changed positions for all PCI-e and SATA cables to different slots. **UPDATE: It got so much WORSE! GPU now never holds its clock, no matter the settings, games are crashing, amd adrenaline is crashing with them, monitor is crashing and turning off for 2-3 sec.** Well ... at least I think this is the issue out of the changes I made.  [https://prnt.sc/pot507](https://prnt.sc/pot507) seems to hold it okay in AIDA tho.

For example AC: origins went from 70FPS on ultra to 40 FPS ultra -&gt; low. No matter the settings. And this is what the graph looks like while playing it (or trying to)  [https://prnt.sc/potcbv](https://prnt.sc/potcbv) Also when alt-tabbing from game now it just turns white and has to be turned off using task manager. WTF? o.O

**Setting -50% power draw** on GPU - results in GPU running at 1300Mhz thus always being at 100% usage in demanding games =&gt; same results as using resolution scaling to force 100% usage on GPU - only fixes it in benchmarks =&gt; **no PSU issue?**

**Found stable manual CPU OC** \- 4.2Ghz all cores at 1.3625v with PBO disabled - with PBO enabled PC won't boot with these settings - *20-ish% improvement* \- last time I managed to get 3.95 with PBO enabled and voltage set to auto - anything above resulted in PC not booting - same-ish improvement. But rather using bios default for now. Even tho this manul OC gives me 300 more points in 3D mark ....

**Memory bandwith tested with Aida94:**

Aida64 cache and memory bench =&gt; [https://prnt.sc/popq2r](https://prnt.sc/popq2r)

Aida64 memory read bench: 51461 MB/s

Aida64 memory write bench: 28745 MB/s

Aida64 memory copy bench: 48905 MB/s

Aida64 latency bench: 68,7 ns

**Changed RAM from slot 2 and 4 to slot 1 and 3** \- took like 3 restarts to boot up, before the PC just light up but no display, no keyboard and mouse were working -&gt; put them back to slot 2 and 4

**Tightening GPU backplate screws** \- 0 improvement

**DPC latency tested:**  [https://prnt.sc/pophrk](https://prnt.sc/pophrk) never gets under 1000 and to green values

**60Hz vs 75Hz** set on the monitor as well as **HDMI/DP** cable (even bought new one going from 1.2DP to 1.4DP with golden connectors) and **FreeSync OFF/ON** \- 0 improvement

**My MB has 0 settings for PCIE** in BIOS - just to enable/disable virtualization =&gt; can't try PCIE3 - **GPU-z shows PCIE1.1 when on desktop and PCIE4 when using it's benchmark**

**OC + undervolt x UC + undervolt x defaults** on each component one by one or together =&gt; difference in temps, stutters remain

**Checked MB QVL** \- last update is from the day it got released and has nearly no components listed, not even the GPU or anything (**ASUS prime x570-p**)

**Tried updating AHCI-SATA drivers**: going from standard windows drivers to AMD ones result in infinite windows loading screen

**Tried affinity for cores 6-12 and also disabling SMT** (in cases it jumps across cores) - 0 improvement. Or maybe it just did not stop it from jumping across cores?

**New observation 1**: When alt-tabbing from game to desktop or the other way around, it blinks. Like ... desktop blinks into the game before stablizing, same goes the other way around and the same happens when opening apps for example opening chrome: it appears, right after it appears it blinks black and white and stabilizes. Also when values change in monitoring SW like GPU-u or HWinfo64 they don't just change, they blink a little white before appearing.

**"New" observation 2:** It's the first load of something that is stuttering in apps - all AMD adrenaline tabs (gaming, video, system etc.) stutter the first time they are opened. Like insane choppy rollout and CPU spikes to highest possible clock - when opened the second time they are not choppy anymore and CPU stays at base 3.6Ghz. Same happens with ingame benchmark for example. The first time you turn it on, it starts choppy for a second. Like really low FPS (10-20) before it gets up to normal FPS. The second time I turn it on - starts at normal FPS

**ORIGINAL POST:**

**Rig: (2 weeks old, brand new)**

**GPU:** Sapphire Pulse RX 5700XT  / *previously RX 480 XFX Black Edition*

**CPU:** Ryzen 5 3600 (PBO + Auto OC) / *Previously i5 6600k @4.8Ghz OC*

**PSU:** 650W Seasonic focus plus gold / *Previously EVGA 650GS*

**RAM:** CL 16 3600Mhz crucial ballistix sport / *Previously Corsair Vengeance 3200Mhz 16CL*

**MB:** Asus x570 prime-p / *Previously AsRock Fatality Gaming K6 Z170*

**Case:** Fractal Meshify C / *Previously NZXT elite s340*

**Case fans:** 2x Noctua 140PWM + 2x Noctua 120PWM / *Previously "similiar setup"*

**CPU cooler:** Mugen Scythe 5 RevB / *Previously NZXT Kraken x42*

**SSD:** 1TB Crucial mx500 / *Previously Samsung EVO 850 250gb + WD Blue EX 1TB*

**Monitor:** LG 29um-68p Freesync capable (40-75Hz range) 2560x1080 - same

**Windows 10** build 1903 / *Previously 1803 or 1809* / + AMD Adrenalin 19.10.1 (going from 19.9 it fixed flickering on 75 Hz screens with freesync enabled) with latest chipset driver and latest MB Bios

&amp;#x200B;

For 3 years my old rig was smooth as butter. Not a single stutter. Ever. Not even with huge drops during explosions from 60 to 30 FPS (FreeSync range changed with CRU to 30-75Hz). But after I sell it because of lower FPS and buy a new one it is way worse? :O

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue:**

**Bad performance in all games** (even tho with vsync off and no limiter this rig plays newest AAA games all maxed at 80 FPS+) and **all aplications =&gt; microfreezes** when browsing, opening apps, scrolling through AMD adrenaline tabs (screen, games, etc.), microfreezes in game during anything =&gt; actually playing the game, just browsing inventory, changing tabs (map, quests, side quests etc.)

**Full system freeze when something outside of the game occurs** =&gt; controller disconnected, discord message, steam friend comes online =&gt; in game drop to 1-2 FPS for 1-2 seconds till it gets back to normal.

**Microfreezes/stuttering** happens even if the game is limited and kept **at steady 60 or 75 fps or whatever value W/O even dropping** =&gt; **imput lag jumps** from 16ms to 80-100ms when stuttering occurs and make the whole system go crazy - **SSD usage spikes** (from 5-10% to 50-60%), **CPU usually drops PBO 4.192 GHz and drops to 3.5 Ghz**, **Ethernet card download jumps to 20mb/s+** even tho after monitoring it there is no application downloading anything.

**Freesync** is of course **ON** in both monitor settings and AMD adrenaline

**Textures** in games sometimes **pop up** =&gt; instead of smooth transition when something moves it sometimes just a position where it is supposed to end - for example clothes moving in the wind

**Stutters** happen **with every autosave** in game, **with every starting cutscene** or during (cutscenes in AC:Origins even tho shown to be max FPS actually look like 5-ish FPS =&gt; slideshow jumping sections by 2 seconds instead of fluid video)

&amp;#x200B;

**What I tried so far:**

**Fresh W10** installation with **fresh 19.10.1 AMD drivers** \- 0 improvement

**Disabled everything in W10** that might be the cause: **DVR, gamebar, fullscreen optimization, exploit protection, unnecessary services etc.** \- *0 improvement*

**Disabled parking** and set Turbo boost and Frequency index with QuickCPU to 100% - *0 improvement*

**Disabled PBO and instead used manual OC** to 3.95 (anything above was unstable) to get rid of clocks jumping up and down - approx. **20% reduction in stutters**

**Tried RAM** at default settings without XMP, tried RAM at XMP, tried RAM with custom timings - *0 improvements*

**Setting game priority** from normal to high in both task manager and in registry - *0 improvement*

**Tried all combinations of sync** \- vsync on/off/enhanced + limiter 2 fps under max refresh rate/witout limiter + freesync on/off etc. - all the same, **everything stutters**

**Tried ISLC** to automatically clean system memory if standby list exceeds 1024MB and free memory gets lower than 2048MB

**Tried** setting ingame **upscalling to 120-200%** =&gt; forcing GPU to run at 100% usage at all times and stop it from fluctuating - **99.9% reduction of stutters BUT IN BENCHMARKS ONLY :(** \- used to be choppy as hell in all game benchmarks, with upscalling ultra buttery smooth as long as it makes GPU cry.  **Actual gameplay stutters reduced by 15-20%** =======&gt; at first it looked like ryzen 3600 is insane bottleneck so GPU at 100% fixes it and made me so happy before I tried actual gameplay.

**Removing** 1 stick of **ram** then the other, **changing ram** slots - *0 improvement*

**Changing all cables** from PSU - *0 improvement*

**Running CHKDSK, MemTest, Aida64** stability test, **Unigine Heaven, Cinebech R20, 3DMark** for hours - **0 issues found** \- even under stress tests temperature on **CPU under 65C, GPU under 65C overall and 75C junction, chipset tops at 66C**. Unfortunately **NEW X570 ASUS BOARDS GOT VRM HIDDEN!!!** But I chose x570 prime-p directly because of benchmakrs showing it is the best cooled MB of them all even amongst expensive ones so I hope *MY* VRMs are not "in hell" :D

PS: while typing this topic I got a **little freeze** twice which resulted in the text fast forward appearing a bit later and noticed a liiiiittle tiny **spike in CPU usage - approx. 5%** and as well as boost in clock then right back. Also while this happened I heard a feint sqreeching sound. This happened for the first time ever tho... and keeps happening whenever I open an app or something.

**Feelings :D** ... I have not played without buttery smooth working freesync for years ... idk if this is just **Freesync** not working and people who don't have it so far are enduring this terrible experience :D but to me atm ... it is a waste of 1500 euro ... what is 9999 FPS good for when it looks like 3 ...

**PLEASE if anyone has similiar issues and has some suggestions or FOUND THE FIX let me (and others reading this topic) know.**

**Cheers!**
I need a powerful computer that could run games on ultra 1440p at 60 hz at least, im a starter so idk a lot about this, can i make this cheaper? obviously without making it worst, this would be a computer for videogames, 3d stuff like autocad 3d and video editing.

My budget is 1600 usd max, and if you can include mouse and keyboard that fits on the budget, ill fricking love you.

It‚Äôs loose when I plug a charging cable in. Idk what to do. I haven‚Äôt tried anything so far except make a post here. Model code is NP530E5M-X03US
My motherboard is slowly dying out on me (RAM slots are losing functionality) so it looks like I'll need to make an upgrade soon. My current system uses a LGA1150 CPU socket which I'm aware is kinda outdated nowadays. I play relatively graphically intense games and a little bit of vr on the side. I haven't kept up to date on the current meta of CPUs and mobos. What should I invest in with $400 to keep my system on the road for the next few years?

I've been doing a lot of research, and I'm very excited for my very first build! I thought it would be good to get some final feedback from the community before I start buying my parts. I managed to put this list together at right around the $1,000 range with the goal of getting decent gaming performance at 1080p. I mostly play sandbox and simulation games (Factorio, Rimworld, Cities: Skylines, Minecraft) but also hope to run more demanding AAA titles on occasion (Cyberpunk 2077 when it comes out). I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or constructive feedback! Here it is:

Additional questions I have:  
\-I've been reading about incompatibilities between certain motherboards and 3rd generation Ryzen. I believe this one is compatible, but would anyone be able to confirm this?  
\-I chose a relatively cheap SSD that still seems reputable. Is it worth considering a more expensive model like the Samsung 860 or 970, or should this be good enough?  
\-Are there any other potential compatibility issues I should be aware of? For example, will this SSD work with my motherboard?

As you can tell, I'm brand new to this, so I may respond with questions. Thank you for your help!

I need a powerful computer that could run games on ultra 1440p at 60 hz at least, im a starter so idk a lot about this, can i make this cheaper? obviously without making it worst, this would be a computer for videogames, 3d stuff like autocad 3d and video editing.

My budget is 1600 usd max, and if you can include mouse and keyboard that fits on the budget, ill fricking love you.

My motherboard is slowly dying out on me (RAM slots are losing functionality) so it looks like I'll need to make an upgrade soon. My current system uses a LGA1150 CPU socket which I'm aware is kinda outdated nowadays. I play relatively graphically intense games and a little bit of vr on the side. I haven't kept up to date on the current meta of CPUs and mobos. What should I invest in with $400 to keep my system on the road for the next few years?

 **Samsung** **SyncMaster 2443** is the monitor and it supports VGA and dvi-D
Hello, sorry for reposting, but the topic died and noone is reacting or reading new updates (I marked them 1-6). Please ... help :D I haven't slept for like a month trying to make my PC work as intended for 1500 EUR pc ...

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE6:** Adding some **CPU usages and latency screenshots during actual gaming** (ESO and AC:Origins as those are the only games on me atm after like 50th windows reinstall ...)  [https://prnt.sc/pw5g7e](https://prnt.sc/pw5g7e) \- latency,  [https://prnt.sc/pw5gcf](https://prnt.sc/pw5gcf) \- cpu usage during AC: Origins,  [https://prnt.sc/pw5gvi](https://prnt.sc/pw5gvi) \- cpu usage during AC: Origins (close up look on first 6 cores),  [https://prnt.sc/pw5h7o](https://prnt.sc/pw5h7o)  \- cpu usage while playing ESO ... I see lots of threads and latency (well all the latency) coming from system kernel ... Any ideas what it might be? I guess some drivers, but is there a way to get to know which? (already tried disabling all the usb I don't use, lan and audio card - and not just drivers, in bios even ...) .. **maybe chipset drivers suck?** Can't find newer than September ... forgot to make frametime screenshot, but it is a "rollercoaster" .. ms ingame jumping from 15ms all the way up to 100ms ...

**UPDATE5:** suddenly started getting **crackling sound on all devices** (monitor speakers, 2.1 logitech speakers and hyperx cloud 2 headset) when clicking on stuff, opening apps, changing volume etc... nothing except for some windows defender updates went through ....

**UPDATE4: tried using latencymon** instead of dpclat and these are the results! **terrible!** I browsed the net tho and did not find any solution ... :/ hopefully 1909 windows will fix this. I blame it on windows :D as I found several topics about 1903 causing stutters and freesync not working ... (**will try downgrading to 1809**) these are my findings (during 3dmark):  [https://prnt.sc/pvkodn](https://prnt.sc/pvkodn) ,  [https://prnt.sc/pvkohv](https://prnt.sc/pvkohv) Because now that I think about it my old PC was at 1803 even and all was smooth as hell ... **UPDATE:** todays 1909 update helped nothing unfortunately ...

CONCLUSION

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup. Check for BIOS updates. 

LatencyMon has been analyzing your system for  0:07:18  (h:mm:ss) on all processors.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The interrupt to process latency reflects the measured interval that a usermode process needed to respond to a hardware request from the moment the interrupt service routine started execution. This includes the scheduling and execution of a DPC routine, the signaling of an event and the waking up of a usermode thread from an idle wait state in response to that event.

 REPORTED HARD PAGEFAULTS

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hard pagefaults are events that get triggered by making use of virtual memory that is not resident in RAM but backed by a memory mapped file on disk. The process of resolving the hard pagefault requires reading in the memory from disk while the process is interrupted and blocked from execution.

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE3:** tried **Project Mercury** (simplified process lasso) to disable SMT conflict and jumping CCX. At first it gave me insane FPS boost! And I mean like 30% or more but did not fix the stutter. The next day it lowered FPS instead ... bamboozled ...

**UPDATE2:** all **synthetic benchmarks are running smooth** as hell, **GPU usage at 99%**, all looks good. Actually playing some **games** tho even when the **FPS is low, like 40FPS ... the GPU refuses to run at 99% ... it jumps between 30-70%**. It only keeps clock during benchmarks. It seems like all my **games are trying to to run on CPU and ignoring GPU ...**

**UPDATE1:** **latest ASUS bios** finally let me change **pci-e lanes to gen3, it did not help tho**. Everything is still super choppy. What still helps the most is using resolution scaling or VSR and setting ingame resolution to 8k even. For some reason it makes everything much smoother. Tried playing ESO for example and it is unplayable at my resolution. **At 8k it even gets more FPS and it looks much smoother LOL**... Some fps drops remain smooth even tho they are by 20, some fps drops cause micro freeze that you want to cry tho (so so working Freesync?)... still ... making the game run at 8k etc forces GPU to be at max usage so it lifts load from CPU and it becomes muuuuuch smoother. So either my ryzen **3600 is broken, or it's just crap CPU?** :D bottlenecking my GPU hard ... OR it's the ram ... because I have seen some ram comparisons and some ram had insane frametime spikes while at the same avarage FPS as some other rams being completely stable ... and frametime is my issue. It jumps by 100ms during stutters... **Asus bios version 2404 (agesa 1.0.0.4b)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What I tried so far according to comments: (ty so much for trying to help!)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Using 2 pci-e cables** \- 1 for 8 pin 1 for 6 pin - 0 improvement. Also changed positions for all PCI-e and SATA cables to different slots. **UPDATE: It got so much WORSE! GPU now never holds its clock, no matter the settings, games are crashing, amd adrenaline is crashing with them, monitor is crashing and turning off for 2-3 sec.** Well ... at least I think this is the issue out of the changes I made.  [https://prnt.sc/pot507](https://prnt.sc/pot507) seems to hold it okay in AIDA tho.

For example AC: origins went from 70FPS on ultra to 40 FPS ultra -&gt; low. No matter the settings. And this is what the graph looks like while playing it (or trying to)  [https://prnt.sc/potcbv](https://prnt.sc/potcbv) Also when alt-tabbing from game now it just turns white and has to be turned off using task manager. WTF? o.O

**Setting -50% power draw** on GPU - results in GPU running at 1300Mhz thus always being at 100% usage in demanding games =&gt; same results as using resolution scaling to force 100% usage on GPU - only fixes it in benchmarks =&gt; **no PSU issue?**

**Found stable manual CPU OC** \- 4.2Ghz all cores at 1.3625v with PBO disabled - with PBO enabled PC won't boot with these settings - *20-ish% improvement* \- last time I managed to get 3.95 with PBO enabled and voltage set to auto - anything above resulted in PC not booting - same-ish improvement. But rather using bios default for now. Even tho this manul OC gives me 300 more points in 3D mark ....

**Memory bandwith tested with Aida94:**

Aida64 cache and memory bench =&gt; [https://prnt.sc/popq2r](https://prnt.sc/popq2r)

Aida64 memory read bench: 51461 MB/s

Aida64 memory write bench: 28745 MB/s

Aida64 memory copy bench: 48905 MB/s

Aida64 latency bench: 68,7 ns

**Changed RAM from slot 2 and 4 to slot 1 and 3** \- took like 3 restarts to boot up, before the PC just light up but no display, no keyboard and mouse were working -&gt; put them back to slot 2 and 4

**Tightening GPU backplate screws** \- 0 improvement

**DPC latency tested:**  [https://prnt.sc/pophrk](https://prnt.sc/pophrk) never gets under 1000 and to green values

**60Hz vs 75Hz** set on the monitor as well as **HDMI/DP** cable (even bought new one going from 1.2DP to 1.4DP with golden connectors) and **FreeSync OFF/ON** \- 0 improvement

**My MB has 0 settings for PCIE** in BIOS - just to enable/disable virtualization =&gt; can't try PCIE3 - **GPU-z shows PCIE1.1 when on desktop and PCIE4 when using it's benchmark**

**OC + undervolt x UC + undervolt x defaults** on each component one by one or together =&gt; difference in temps, stutters remain

**Checked MB QVL** \- last update is from the day it got released and has nearly no components listed, not even the GPU or anything (**ASUS prime x570-p**)

**Tried updating AHCI-SATA drivers**: going from standard windows drivers to AMD ones result in infinite windows loading screen

**Tried affinity for cores 6-12 and also disabling SMT** (in cases it jumps across cores) - 0 improvement. Or maybe it just did not stop it from jumping across cores?

**New observation 1**: When alt-tabbing from game to desktop or the other way around, it blinks. Like ... desktop blinks into the game before stablizing, same goes the other way around and the same happens when opening apps for example opening chrome: it appears, right after it appears it blinks black and white and stabilizes. Also when values change in monitoring SW like GPU-u or HWinfo64 they don't just change, they blink a little white before appearing.

**"New" observation 2:** It's the first load of something that is stuttering in apps - all AMD adrenaline tabs (gaming, video, system etc.) stutter the first time they are opened. Like insane choppy rollout and CPU spikes to highest possible clock - when opened the second time they are not choppy anymore and CPU stays at base 3.6Ghz. Same happens with ingame benchmark for example. The first time you turn it on, it starts choppy for a second. Like really low FPS (10-20) before it gets up to normal FPS. The second time I turn it on - starts at normal FPS

&amp;#x200B;

For 3 years my old rig was smooth as butter. Not a single stutter. Ever. Not even with huge drops during explosions from 60 to 30 FPS (FreeSync range changed with CRU to 30-75Hz). But after I sell it because of lower FPS and buy a new one it is way worse? :O

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue:**

**Bad performance in all games** (even tho with vsync off and no limiter this rig plays newest AAA games all maxed at 80 FPS+) and **all aplications =&gt; microfreezes** when browsing, opening apps, scrolling through AMD adrenaline tabs (screen, games, etc.), microfreezes in game during anything =&gt; actually playing the game, just browsing inventory, changing tabs (map, quests, side quests etc.)

**Full system freeze when something outside of the game occurs** =&gt; controller disconnected, discord message, steam friend comes online =&gt; in game drop to 1-2 FPS for 1-2 seconds till it gets back to normal.

**Microfreezes/stuttering** happens even if the game is limited and kept **at steady 60 or 75 fps or whatever value W/O even dropping** =&gt; **imput lag jumps** from 16ms to 80-100ms when stuttering occurs and make the whole system go crazy - **SSD usage spikes** (from 5-10% to 50-60%), **CPU usually drops PBO 4.192 GHz and drops to 3.5 Ghz**, **Ethernet card download jumps to 20mb/s+** even tho after monitoring it there is no application downloading anything.

**Freesync** is of course **ON** in both monitor settings and AMD adrenaline

**Textures** in games sometimes **pop up** =&gt; instead of smooth transition when something moves it sometimes just a position where it is supposed to end - for example clothes moving in the wind

**Stutters** happen **with every autosave** in game, **with every starting cutscene** or during (cutscenes in AC:Origins even tho shown to be max FPS actually look like 5-ish FPS =&gt; slideshow jumping sections by 2 seconds instead of fluid video)

&amp;#x200B;

**What I tried so far:**

**Fresh W10** installation with **fresh 19.10.1 AMD drivers** \- 0 improvement

**Disabled everything in W10** that might be the cause: **DVR, gamebar, fullscreen optimization, exploit protection, unnecessary services etc.** \- *0 improvement*

**Disabled parking** and set Turbo boost and Frequency index with QuickCPU to 100% - *0 improvement*

**Disabled PBO and instead used manual OC** to 3.95 (anything above was unstable) to get rid of clocks jumping up and down - approx. **20% reduction in stutters**

**Tried RAM** at default settings without XMP, tried RAM at XMP, tried RAM with custom timings - *0 improvements*

**Setting game priority** from normal to high in both task manager and in registry - *0 improvement*

**Tried all combinations of sync** \- vsync on/off/enhanced + limiter 2 fps under max refresh rate/witout limiter + freesync on/off etc. - all the same, **everything stutters**

**Tried ISLC** to automatically clean system memory if standby list exceeds 1024MB and free memory gets lower than 2048MB

**Tried** setting ingame **upscalling to 120-200%** =&gt; forcing GPU to run at 100% usage at all times and stop it from fluctuating - **99.9% reduction of stutters BUT IN BENCHMARKS ONLY :(** \- used to be choppy as hell in all game benchmarks, with upscalling ultra buttery smooth as long as it makes GPU cry.  **Actual gameplay stutters reduced by 15-20%** =======&gt; at first it looked like ryzen 3600 is insane bottleneck so GPU at 100% fixes it and made me so happy before I tried actual gameplay.

**Removing** 1 stick of **ram** then the other, **changing ram** slots - *0 improvement*

**Changing all cables** from PSU - *0 improvement*

**Running CHKDSK, MemTest, Aida64** stability test, **Unigine Heaven, Cinebech R20, 3DMark** for hours - **0 issues found** \- even under stress tests temperature on **CPU under 65C, GPU under 65C overall and 75C junction, chipset tops at 66C**. Unfortunately **NEW X570 ASUS BOARDS GOT VRM HIDDEN!!!** But I chose x570 prime-p directly because of benchmakrs showing it is the best cooled MB of them all even amongst expensive ones so I hope *MY* VRMs are not "in hell" :D

PS: while typing this topic I got a **little freeze** twice which resulted in the text fast forward appearing a bit later and noticed a liiiiittle tiny **spike in CPU usage - approx. 5%** and as well as boost in clock then right back. Also while this happened I heard a feint sqreeching sound. This happened for the first time ever tho... and keeps happening whenever I open an app or something.

**Feelings :D** ... I have not played without buttery smooth working freesync for years ... idk if this is just **Freesync** not working and people who don't have it so far are enduring this terrible experience :D but to me atm ... it is a waste of 1500 euro ... what is 9999 FPS good for when it looks like 3 ...

**PLEASE if anyone has similiar issues and has some suggestions or FOUND THE FIX let me (and others reading this topic) know.**

**Cheers!**
I have a samsung un65hu7250f and over the course of the past year or so I have noticed that they have pretty much stopped support of the smart tv apps first they removed the wwe app and now no support for disney plus. This is pretty aggervating due to this tv really not being that old. Is there anyway to manually add apps to this tv or if anything upgrade the system os.

Both my PS4 Pro in my Samsung TV can handle 4K but when I go to the 4K UHD section and pick a movie but the movie only says HD in the description is there any way to actually tell if it's 4K. I would think in the description it would actually say 4K if it was going to stream in 4k
Both the app on the Samsung TV and PS4 Pro say the same thing

Thanks

**Monitor one**

**Monitor two**

[Very long amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-32-Inch-Curved-Monitor-LC32JG56QQNXZA/dp/B07R6YFTYF/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=1440p+WQHD+monitor&amp;qid=1573604845&amp;refinements=p_n_feature_eleven_browse-bin%3A17726573011%7C17726574011%7C17726575011%7C17726576011%2Cp_n_size_browse-bin%3A3547808011%2Cp_n_feature_fourteen_browse-bin%3A17751789011&amp;rnid=17751784011&amp;s=pc&amp;sr=1-3)

&amp;#x200B;

I do have a GTX 1080 so no idea if AMD freesync actually works or not with it. There was some kind of event happened this year that makes it seem like it could.

Both monitors are

* 1440p
* 144hz
* 30 inches or higher and curved (which was a must and ruled out [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZXZ3QBD/ref=psdc_1292115011_t1_B07BDQNDKY?th=1).

I'm thinking maybe monitor one since the reviews are great for the colors on it which is a very important factor to me. Monitor 2 I have no idea what it's colors are like. Monitor 1 however I don't know the contrast ratio or how good the darks and lights are.
So here's the deal.

i switched to rogers from my old provider because i got a 20% discount at the time. had to constantly call in to have the discount added back because each month it'd be "magically accidentally removed". I no longer work for the company that was giving me that discount so i no longer have it. i knew my bill would go up, but not this much.

Me and my sister are on the same plan. we have 2 pohones and 2 tablets. none of these are paid off :

&amp;#x200B;

x1 Samsung S10, on it's current plan costing, 140.00

x1 Iphone X on it's current plan costing 85.00

x1 Samsung Tab-A costing 22.50

x1 Ipad Costing 30.00

I figured everything with tax would be coming out to about \~300.00 or so, which is still really high as all hell. i understand that these device are not paid off , but the prices above are supposed to include the device cost as well. when i was on the discount it was around \~240 for all 4 devices which is not too terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

however, the bill keeps coming in as above \~400.00 this month it was \~410.00, before it was 480.00! there were some occasional text to family in the states and a single call that cost $8.00 that my sister made. but that's it. Rogers cannot tell me why the bill is as high as it is and will only say it's accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

they said to  switch us on to the unlimited plans to "save us money" but the plans cost the same amount as my old plans so there is no savings what so ever. I'm on 20, becasue i use my device alot at school and on the transit there. my sister is on the 10 gb.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes it even worse is that where i go to school (College) there is absolutely no rogers cell signal, and i'm there 50% of the day monday-friday. 10% of the time i get Emergency calls only, the rest it says No Service. "We don't have a tower in your area.", they say, so they tell me to use the school's wifi to do everything, which i cannot use because the transmission and security protocols the schools network uses do not work on my android device. so i'm paying for services that i can't even use more than half the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel trapped. i'm a college student and i can't just pay off these devices, yet i can't even use them. there's over 2000+ owing total on all 4 devices, although only 800 or so is mine, i still cannot just go pay them off. 

&amp;#x200B;

how can i go about lowering my bill? i hate to say this but i'll be leaving rogers if it cannot be lowered. yes i owe money still, buton an unrelated note, my mother fucked up my credit (which is for another story) so i already have bad credit. adding this to it would make much difference. eventually i would pay it off of course.

&amp;#x200B;

any ideas guys? thanks.
Hello ultrawidemasterrace fam! I'm in need of your assistance.

As the title suggests, is such a thing possible if I wanted to purchase two of these monitors in order to stack them with each other. I'm looking to buying two Ergotron HX desk mounts, but i dont think it would be high enough to mount them in a top and bottom configuration. The machine is currently running two 2080ti's so it should be good in the graphics department. In addition, I won't be looking to using a wall mount due to having a standing desk.

Thanks you in advanced! Fyi this is not for me. Wish it was though lol
So I have been working on this application. I have yet to get much of the backend working properly. I did the front end and now am trying to integrate the native part into the UI.

I have UI Layouts for both a tablet and phone. I have been using the tablet layout mostly due to ease. Today I went back to using the emulator while I was taking my son to a Dr. appointment. Now my app start crashing from the beginning. Not sure why.

Emulator is running 8.0

Here is the problem code (It does not crash here):

    val dir = createProjectFolder(this@MainActivity)
            if (dir != null) {
    
                val ex: InputStream = assets.open("ex.tgz");
                val proc = ProcessBuilder("tar", "-xzf", "-").directory(dir).start()
    
                try {
                    val buffer = ByteArray(4096);
    
                    fun pump(): Boolean {
                        val n = ex.read(buffer)
                        return n &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; proc.outputStream.write(buffer, 0, n).let { true }
                    }
    
                    while (pump()) {
                    }
                    proc.outputStream.close()
                } catch (e: IOException) {
                    Log.d("FOO", e.toString())
                }
    
                Log.e("FOO", "OUT: ${String(proc.inputStream.readBytes())}")
                Log.e("FOO", "ERR: ${String(proc.errorStream.readBytes())}")
    
                proc.waitFor()
    
                Log.d("FOO", "DONE")
            }

What is happening is that I am getting and IOException after about 8K of reading. The logical says: 

    D/FOO: java.io.IOException: write failed: EPIPE (Broken pipe)
    E/FOO: OUT: 
    E/FOO: ERR: tar: exec gunzip: Permission denied
        tar: read error
    D/FOO: DONE

So I figure that at some point along the way, I had some permission set that I inadvertently took out... but maybe not?!

I uninstalled the app on the tablet and ran it from scratch, everything worked fine still. 

I looked in the settings to see what permissions the app had: No Permission Required

Tablet is Samsung TAB A 2019 running Android 9.0

Phone is Samsung J7 2018 running Android 8.0

Emulator is Pixel 2 XL Running 8.0  


Is this a problem with Android 8? how can I fix it?
Hey guys.

My best friend and I both preordered 256G Verizon Note 10+ (she got the 5G).  From day 1, we've had strange battery issues.  At 10% and under, both devices die super fast.  Like, sometimes it will go from 7% to dead before you can plug it in.  We started charging it sooner and called it a day.

Recently, it now happens under 15%.

We don't leave them on chargers overnight or anything, we're not careless with them.  

Is anyone else having this issue?  I've talked to Samsung and they want me to factory reset because we've tried a handful of other methods to no avail.  I just don't want to do that.
