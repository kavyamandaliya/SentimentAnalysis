Edit: thanks for the silver!!

Okay, first post, on mobile etc. this is probably going to be long because it was a few separate encounters, so sorry in advance.

Background: I worked in a small town electronics/ appliance store when I was in high school (2015). I was only a temporary Christmas worker, so I wasn‚Äôt till trained. My job was to help with incoming stock, stock shelves, keep the store tidy and help customers to the best of my ability and then hand them off to the full timers to complete the sale. I‚Äôm quite tech inclined and could usually help out with what customers are asking, but if I got out of my depth I‚Äôd ask one of the full time staff to assist.

Okay, onto the story:

Cast: 
Me = lil teenage moi

Annie: full time co worker

Dad: main harasser (not my dad)

Mum: his wife

Girl: their daughter

Boy: their son

So I was stocking shelves one day when it was pretty quiet and this family came in. Dad immediately beelines for me and tells me they need a tablet. Okay, no worries. We have a tablet station set up with all of the android tablets and then a seperate display for the iPads because Apple likes to be different. Kids go off to play on iPads, Dad wanders off and I ask Mum what they need the tablet for etc. she says it‚Äôs for girl‚Äôs school work. She says very shyly that she wants the CHEAPEST tablet (important for later). Sweet, I show her the cheapest one and it fits all her requirements. Okay, time to go out the back and get a boxed one. Dad comes back over and immediately starts asking why we went for that one. I try to explain that it‚Äôs our cheapest option and he starts grilling me on what the difference is between that one and a Samsung one. Well, the price, for a start. Samsung was a solid $400 more. He gets super in depth, grilling me about specifics of the tablets. I‚Äôm not an expert on Android, I‚Äôm better with Apple, so I say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not sure, but let me grab someone who will know‚Äô and signal to Annie, who is at the counter. She comes over. Dad explodes. ‚ÄòNO, YOU NEED TO FINISH DOING YOUR JOB. (To Annie) NOPE GO AWAY, SHE HASN‚ÄôT FINISHED HER JOB.‚Äô This goes on for a few mins while I try to get a word in.
Annie, who has heard everything, says: ‚Äòactually, she‚Äôs a trainee. Her job is to help as much as she can and then get one of us. She‚Äôs done her job.‚Äô Dad gets in a huff but finally shuts up. Annie and mum decide on the cheaper tablet, Annie goes out back to get the boxed one. Dad goes to get kids from iPads and asks me ‚Äòwhat are these?‚Äô I tell him they‚Äôre iPads. ‚ÄòWhy didn‚Äôt you show us these?‚Äô ‚ÄòBecause Mum asked to see the cheapest option and these start at around $500.‚Äô Dad looks pissed and says ‚ÄòI want one of these.‚Äô Mum and I are dumbfounded. Dad is insistent and so Annie and I get them sorted on which one/ storage size etc. They end up spending $500 more than planned. Mum is not happy but I get the vibe she doesn‚Äôt want to stand up to Dad. They head to the counter to buy, and Annie asks how they‚Äôd like to pay. Dad puts a lottery ticket on the counter. Not a winning one, just trash he had in his pocket. Cracks up like it‚Äôs the funniest joke. Howling with laughter. Annie and I are not having it. Annie asks again, and mum reluctantly hands over credit card. They pay, and (finally) leave. Wow. Nightmare over. 


Jk.


They come in the next day. They don‚Äôt know how to set up the iPad. Our store offered tech solution/ help with tech etc but usually it‚Äôs a paid service through a seperate part of the company where someone books and then a solutions employee will come to the store. We don‚Äôt usually sit there and help out ourselves (because we aren‚Äôt trained for it and we don‚Äôt get paid for it), unless it‚Äôs a quick fix or you‚Äôre extra nice.


Family comes in, sits at our finance desk. Asks for help setting up iPad. I‚Äôm not there yet, I didn‚Äôt start until 11 that day but dad insists they only want me to help them, so they hang around. As soon as I walk in (we entered through front doors and walked to back room through the store) he grabs me and tries to pull me over to them. I haven‚Äôt even clocked in or out my stuff away. I‚Äôm trying to tell him this but he‚Äôs breaking out the ‚ÄòYOU NEED TO DO YOUR JOB‚Äô spiel again (never mind that setting up your iPad isn‚Äôt actually my job). It took another employee intervening before he would let me go upstairs. I clock in etc and (reluctantly) head back out. They‚Äôre still waiting for me. Luckily, I actually know a lot about Apple so it‚Äôs not a huge task for me to set up an iPad, though the fact that they didn‚Äôt have an email address (who tf doesn‚Äôt have an email address???) didn‚Äôt help. Took me three hours in the end because Mum didn‚Äôt understand a lot of it. Dad left and came back with food, tried to give me a donut. I declined, not to be rude but mostly because I‚Äôd already eaten and it seemed wrong to take food from a customer/ stranger. He kept trying to shove it in my face and then eventually decided to eat it himself. I was very stoked when I finally saw the home screen of the iPad and I could send them tf home.


I won‚Äôt keep going on here because this is SUPER long already, but they came in a few more times. Bought another tablet that was super expensive (wtf) and then there was another time that he accosted me outside the store demanding I sell him a phone, and then had a massive argument with me when I tried to sell him said phone. I guess upvote for a part 2???

TL;DR: family comes in looking for a cheap tablet, accuse me of not doing my job, buy expensive iPad, need help setting up said iPad, generally waste my time and harass me

... that Samsung uses it to promote their products. :-D

"We want more than only television because dark powers attract us as magically as ..."
I've been developing an app and stumbled upon an issue that's probably very familiar to some of you. I am testing on a Samsung device and everything was working well until I got to the widget.

I am using a JobIntentService and according to the docs, the OS will allocate time to run the background task in API 28+ since it is not high priority. The issue is that Samsung (and other OEM according to [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com)) are meddling with this and "customizing" the experience to "save battery" neutering Android. In the Galaxy S8 almost all apps go to this special sleeping apps list and it won't let even job schedule tasks complete unless you start the app. Once I manually take my app from that list the widget will work as intended.

Has google given any signs of forcing OEMs to stop meddling with this? Dealing with API fragmentation is bad enough that now not even the same API levels behave as expected.


- $420.00 (no tax, comes in green box with no earbuds but a gram of mid-shelf weed only in Canada and California)

- Helio G90T upper mid range "gaming" SoC

- still 4GB RAM

- 128GB storage (only expandable with a specific Samsung branded 32GB SD card via unfixable glitch)

- 2080mAh battery made by Doogee (no quick charging because it's hella small)

- triple 12MP rear cameras (telephoto/normal/monochrome) lmao you THOUGHT they'd put a wide angle in, but they didn't

- 2nd Gen gestures, including "flip off phone to immediately hang up call" and "make jerking motion with hand to open up preinstalled Pornhub app"
I haven‚Äôt had a Samsung phone in a few years now (I think my last Samsung phone was the S4) and now I‚Äôm finally getting the S10+ with 512 GB and the Samsung Galaxy Active 2 watch (I‚Äôm going all out lol). Getting them both tomorrow. Before I get the phone, what do you guys think of it and what are some things I should do first? I might download a custom launcher first, because I heard that Nova was a good one lol.
Many people underestimate the impact of the other 9 players on the game when it comes to Sneaky's performance. When bot isn't your priority and your support is a donkey in lane (and many team fights imo) it's very difficult to capitalize.

Not to mention we're less than a year divorced from Smoothie and Sneaky destroying everyone in lane, even without jungle help.

Sneaky is fantastic teamfighter, never tilts, always has the chance to clutch steal, and can be dominant in lane and teamfights when given the resources. (Series vs WE, drawing respect bans on Lucian, Vayne, winning games vs samsung on Corki.) There's a reason this guy is up there on the highest kills record in LCS---he's good, and he has been for years.

Maybe you prefer Doublelift or Upset, and maybe you'd even be right, but Sneaky is his own player, extremely skilled, and one of the best NA has ever produced.

Critique his play, point out mistakes, I do too, but give the man the respect he deserves.

Pbs is a great service regardless of the upcoming trial. But it's good to know it's free if you're interested. They also provide tons of educational and arts programming. PBS gave me amazing shows as a kid and continues to provide great content.
With the Disney + release today having exclusive Dolby Vision content. I‚Äôm wondering if any one is having regrets buying a Samsung TV which doesn‚Äôt support Dolby Vision. Be honest with us and yourselves!!

Observed changes: Self Diagnosis screen added, observed less ghosting with ultimate engine, at least on bright (day) scenes. Playing felt less stuttery.

Hi all,

I have been having some obvious lags and performance issues running kernel 5.3.7 and 5.3.8 on my laptop. While using 5.3.7, booting on 5.2.X (can't remember which one it was) restaured my performance. Since it isn't available since the last update, I tried booting on lts and it does also restore my perfs ans stops the lags.

My laptop is a Samsung on Haswell, using the iGPU. I don't really know what to provide you, so to start, here is the output of inxi -Fxz :

Hi! I'm looking at switching to Cricket but have some concerns

Background information: I'm currently on my parents plan with verizon. I want to switch so it's cheaper. 


My coworker switched to cricket &amp; her phone no longer accepted text messages or voicemails. Is this a common issue? I purchased a Samsung S9 for Verizon in May of this year (purchased outright because I'm stupid üôÑ) &amp; really don't want to see that money go to waste when the phone works perfectly fine.
For the purpose of this, I am a minor and I live with my mum.

I have a lot of clothes I don't like, so I want to sell a lot of them and get some nice clothes. Of course she'll support that. She thinks it'll get me closer to her fantasy of me getting signed by an agency and doing lingirie modelling and her taking all of the money from me. 

I am underweight and my mum thinks I'm a perfect weight and she doesn't want me to gain weight. She thinks I'm already 'perfect' and she always try to show off my body to her friends, including in front of my friend too. She will do anything to prevent me from gaining it. The thing is, I barely do any exercise. I want to get a Samsung watch so I can see what I need to do and set goals. What does my mum do? She laughs at me, calls me a wanker for wanting something from Samsung and says that I'm only going to see how lazy I am. Isn't that the point?

Maybe if she actually listened to me for once instead of dismissing everything I say, she would get my point!
I need to buy a new one because the one given to us stock is taking a beating now . HOWEVER I dont really trust the amazon reviews and I havent seen any on Samsung shop... Anyone got any good screen protectors that have ultrasonic fingerprint scanner?
So I‚Äòm following all of these posts that are relevant to the current PC performance issues and wanted to give feedback to my experience after the update.

Before the update my game would crash often, to get it running I did this:
- reinstall shaders
- priority to normal
- cap FPS to 60
(- various graphic settings from low to high)

This stopped the crashes and I could play the game at 60FPS.
However, in ground war I only got like 40-50FPS and in the menu I got very low FPS.

Now after the update I did the same things mentioned above.
The menu feels way smoother but the in game FPS got very unstable and ground war still goes under 50FPS.

BUT THE BIGGEST ISSUE (I cant stress this enough) is mouse lag.
The game feels so clunky and unresponsive with mouse, it makes everything so unprecise.
I think this, since the game is a shooter, is game breaking and it makes me feel sad. (the game has so much potential)

To wrap this whole thing up here are my PC specs:
- Intel i5 6500
- Nvidia RTX2060
- 16GB RAM
- Samsung EVO NVMe SSD

Feel free to give your two cents to this topic in the comments.

PS: Gunfight is the only thing that runs and works super smooth. (I would have been shocked if it wouldn‚Äòt)
I'm looking for a wireless and Bluetooth card that will fit into this PC build:

Preferably, the antennae would hook directly onto the card, instead of being attached via a cord.
Anyone out there experience console-related burn-in?  The TV specs sound amazing but I'm a little worried about OLED burn-in, we have an older HDTV and the XBOX menu is slightly burned into it, I can't drop $2K on a new TV and have something like this happen.  Am I overthinking or is it a legitimate problem?  I've narrowed it down to either this TV or the Samsung Q80.  Thanks in advance.


Not able to watch Disney+ on the Samsung App TV. Anyone else with this problem? I thought it was fixed.
Basically the title. I was super excited for D+, but I can't get it on my TV, which should be comparable. I'm pretty bummed out
&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I primarily plan on using it for browsing the internet, Netflix/Hulu, gaming, and editing pictures. 

I'm by no means a professional, I just take pictures as a hobby and I would like to improve that hobby, but my current computer has prevented me from really getting into it and editing my pictures (my computer is 9.5 years old! definitely time for a new one, huh?). Lightroom and Photoshop would likely be used.

As for gaming, you can probably imagine I'm pretty limited in what my current system can handle, so it's just a lot of older games like Half-Life 1 and 2, GTA III, GTA Vice City, OSRS, League of Legends just to name a few. I plan on continuing to play those games just because they're nostalgic for me, but obviously I want to play modern games as well.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

My budget range is $1000 to $1500, just depending on what you guys recommend and suggest. I can probably go over $1500 a bit if it's really needed, but this is just an approximated amount that I'm allowing myself since I'm not really sure what to expect with pricing to begin with. I‚Äôve never built a PC before. I'm content with spending $1500 or slightly more if someone thinks I should go ahead.

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Honestly, I'm just now beginning this process, so it probably won't be immediately. I'm just trying to get my foot in the door and start figuring things out. I'm new to the world of building a PC. The one I have now was pre-built, from iBuyPower, and I got it in 2010. The only thing that has been upgraded in it is the GPU, and that was still many years ago. If I need to wait on a release of new hardware or something that's expected to be out soon, let me know. I don't particularly care about waiting for holiday deals/discounts unless someone wants to convince me otherwise, because I'd like to have the new computer sooner rather than later.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

Not entirely sure. If anyone wants to recommend specific towers/monitors/keyboards/mice, then please go ahead. I know these things aren't essential to initially building the PC, but I'm not opposed to seeing more options. And I assume I will need to get an OS when I get everything else, so Windows 10 I guess (although I'm not sure if I should get Home or Pro, if someone wants to recommend/explain the difference).

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

United States. I will likely buy everything online. I don't live near a Microcenter.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

I likely won't reuse any of my parts or peripherals. Everything is old or outdated. My monitor is an ASUS 21.5" and I don't have any issues with it, but I do think it's probably time for an upgrade.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I don't really have any intention to overclock unless someone wants to convince me why I might want/need to.

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

Nothing immediately comes to mind, but I am curious if I need to have both a HDD and a SSD, which seems to be a common setup nowadays.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

No real preferences. An average/typical-sized case should be fine so long as all of the components are compatible with it. I am not entirely sure what the differences are. I think I would prefer a case that is black or at least mostly black. I kind of like the cases that have a window, but again no real preference.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Yes. I assume I'll go with Windows 10, but again not sure whether it should be Home or Pro.

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

Here is a build I put together based on other recommendations to me from this subreddit:

You can see my [original post from about a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/dk89du/1500_budget_my_first_build/) if you you want to look at the build suggestions in the comments or compare those comments to the build table I posted. I used the suggestions to put together this list, although I'm not against using one of those other builds to a T, adjusting mine depending on the feedback, or just starting from scratch and using a completely different suggestion.

Questions below:

"Warning! Some AMD B450 chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using Matisse CPUs. Upgrading the BIOS may require a different CPU that is supported by older BIOS revisions."

* Can someone explain in layman terms what this means, and is it actually something to be concerned about? Because it seems like no matter how I adjust the build, that warning or a similar warning pops up. I want this process to be as easy as possible and would like to avoid any difficulties.
* Here is another warning that I'm not sure what it means: "Note: The motherboard M.2 slot #1 shares bandwidth with SATA 6.0 Gb/s ports. When the M.2 slot is populated, two SATA 6.0 Gb/s ports are disabled."

* **EDIT - MOTHERBOARD QUESTION/NOTE ABOUT THESE WARNINGS:** When I select an x570 motherboard, this seems to get rid of those warnings, so I guess I need to choose a different motherboard if I'm going with that CPU. Any recommendations?

* I assume the CPU comes with its own fan, so is it okay to use that fan or would you recommend buying a different one to use instead?

* How many case fans do you recommend? (either with the specific case listed or a different one of your own recommendation)

* Re: the graphics card, I was looking at the Radeon RX 5700 but noticed there is one with the name XFX RX-57XL8MFG6 and another as Sapphire PULSE. I don't fully understand the difference other than the look of it. Does this matter?

* What is the standard suggestion for RAM speed? DDR4-3200? 3600?

These are just a few of the questions off the top of my head, sorry if they seem silly, but I've been a bit out of the loop for a while now. This will be my first new computer since 2010. Please feel free to give additional information or suggestions that I didn't think to ask about, because like I said, I'm new to this and want it to go as smooth as possible.


Hi Folks,

I'm helping my brother build a PC and have everything spec'd out but it I haven't stayed on top of the hardware market for the past few years so am looking for second opinions.

This PC will be used primarily for gaming.  Looking to run high settings at 1440 in games like Battlefield and to build in a bit of futreproofing.

Budget for this build is in the $1500 ballpark ($2k CAD) excluding peripherals.  I'm in Canada so getting parts shouldn't be an issue.

Any input would be much appreciated.
I have a Samsung Galaxy S10+ (AT&amp;T, Pie) with 5.7.3.-3bc6f703d version of Kardia installed. When I attempt to take a screenshot, I get "Can't take screenshot because of security policy."

Our IT police tells me there are no screenshot policies enforced by our Company Portal (includes policy manager).

All other apps allow screenshots (known exceptions like incognito mode in Chrome).  AliveCor support blames it on Android, saying "You are able to screenshot with no issues on an Iphone the issue would be with the android software"  

Why would "Android" arbitrarily prohibit screenshots in Kardia app?  It has to some miss by Kardia developers.

Can anyone report screenshot success on Android?
Anyone have any experience with phone deals during Black Friday (or any other sales)? I feel like every deal I see is for an activation of a new line, which I do not want. If I just want to upgrade my phone, seems like most phones are full price.

My phone died a few days ago and I am willing to wait until BF if it makes sense. However, if I'm gonna end up paying full price anyway, I might as well buy a phone now.

Note: I'm interested in one of the newer models of iPhone/Samsung devices (released within the last year or so). While a lot more frugal, the other budget phones will not work for my needs unfortunately. I've done enough research at this point to know that I have to stick to the high end phones. Thanks!
is there anyone who uses any samsung galaxy tab of any model either 3g or 4g as a personal mobile phone or I am the only weirdo of Reddit that does?
Looking to buy a 75" 4K TV and I've narrowed it down to the Samsung Q80 or Vizio P Series Quantum X. The consensus from rtings is that the Q80 is slightly better, but the Vizio has Dolby Vision. As someone who plans on watching a lot of 4K Blu Rays, is the difference big enough for me to go with the Vizio over the Samsung?

I don't know what happened to Android Auto. In the last few weeks I've noticed that it gets super laggy to the point of a frozen phone screen (I use it on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10). It seems to coincide with some major update the app has been receiving. 

Playing music (YTM or GPM), with Google Maps navigation, and messages incoming every so often, used to be so smooth and flawless. 

Now, the opposite is true.

First up is the MacBook Pro. It work perfectly except the trackpad doesn't make the physical click. It still functions just fine, but it doesn't press down. The battery appears fine, so it's likely just a faulty trackpad. Easily repaired, but not a priority for me right now as I have other things I need to get done. This has Yosemite installed but can be upgraded to Catalina. I just lost my install USB and didn't feel like waiting for it to download. I'm asking **$1,200** for this but I'm open to reasonable offers. Only see three of this exact spec sold recently on eBay, so this is a median price. This will ship with a charger. 

Next up is the Dell. This is the touch screen model. I thought I saw the Dell logo burned into the screen when I was installing Windows, but I didn't see it when Windows was loaded up. Also this has a replacement back panel that says "5490" but it is not. The seller shipped the wrong one and I didn't think it was that big of a deal to return it. This has a Samsung 850 PRO SSD in it. I'm asking **$275 shipped** for this. This will ship with a charger. 

---

Finally the RAM. 

I have a 2x16GB kit of DDR4 2400T SODIMM. I'm asking **$150 shipped** for this. 

I've got 3x 16GB DDR3 sticks of Registered ECC. There's one 10600R and two 12800R sticks. Asking **$15 each or $40 for all shipped**.

Finally I have a single 16GB DDR4 2400T stick. I'm asking **$50 shipped** for this.
I am using steam link through my new Samsung TV and was finally able to get it working well with borderlands 3 (epic game store). After playing around with setting for awhile I was able to bump up my bit rate and turn off hw encoding / decoding and was getting solid picture at 1080 60 fps. Bit rate was near 30 mbps. After playing awhile the picture randomly drops way off and the max bit rate goes down to 3mbps like it is being throttled.

My pc can handle borderlands at 4k so it's not that. I'm on 5 ghz network and can reliably stream 4k video from my pc over Lan.

Thoughts?
I just got a new Samsung 860 Evo 250gb SSD. I have tried moving windows already using easeUS but this pops up "not enough unallocated space on the target disk. To make sure the boot ability of target disk, please delete partitions on there first." I am fairly new to this drive stuff and I can't figure out how to fix this. Help figuring this out would be appreciated or is there another way that I could use? 
Edit: I have also tried deleting partitions from the disk management

Unfortunately today I have to sell some items to help pay for heating oil. I would love to keep these but somethings are more important than holding onto these things. Please comment before sending me a message.

Today's the day that Minecraft Earth goes out on Samsung in the Play Store but due to Prior incidents (I don't know what happened) my camera is broke so I can't play it. (I'm not good at ranting)
Sorry for the stupid questions. I've avoided using lithium ion batterys my whole life because the energy density is a little high for comfort.

So I have a Wowtac A2S and a UV Convoy S2+ (adventures, I know /s), a recharger and some brand name 18650's. 

Anyway I have a few questions:

**Is it dangerous to use unprotected Samsung** S4737 18650 (3500mAh) **batterys in these flashlights?**

(If so can probably still return them).

**The A2S needs a slightly longer battery, the options I have found, for using a unprotected 18650**, when searching are:

1. Solder blob on the battery (risky)

2. Super magnet spacer (adds resistance)

3. DIY a 3mm insulated metal cored washer disk / spacer / thing. (fiddly)

**Did I miss any other options?**
I can't spoof using my S9 since vmos is down. Anyone who are using android but still can spoof using downgrading method? I have a samsung j7. Thanks

Hey Guys,

Ive been gaming and working on this [rig](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/DHrb8M) for the past 2-3 years, and im breaking it down into two smaller ones for my brother and parents. As i am in need of portability, i will be buying myself a laptop in its place. My brother will be using this for light gaming, and all his productivity and studies. My parents use their computer to browse, reply to emails and for light work related tasks.

All parts in the lists marked $0.0 are ones I already own, and all three builds are small form factor mini itx builds. The remaining Seagate Firecuda will be part of a Raspberry Pi NAS project i wish to undertake. Im looking for anything that I may have missed, or suggestions on how I can improve this on a tight budget. I also know im overspending for the streacom case, any alternative options will be appreciated but they must include space for an optical drive.

Thanking you in advance for your help and time!

Looking for some advice on which to get for a very dark bedroom for watching mainly at night.

Going to use it for netflix/streaming services, and some single player gaming.

Was looking at the LG C9 and the oled equivalent sony, but worried about burn in, plus the pricepoint is higher.

Also considering the xbr900f, or some samsung qled but not sure which tv is best for a dark room. I prefer the tv to be easy on the eyes at night (really dont want some super bright tv that i will squint at when watching)

I game more a bit more than casual, usually single player games and some Dota and CS:Go from time to time. Also i'm using the pc for Ableton and Adobe CC (i'm a graphic designer).

Also, later i plan on buying a 27inch 144hz 1440p monitor.

Thanks a lot in advance! :)
I have been trying all day to add the Disney+ channel to my devices to no avail.  Older Samsung Smart TV?  Nada.  Older Roku?  Nein.  Brand new Vizio?  Nope.  Cast it from my phone?  Not happening. 

I'm disappointed that I can't just watch what I'm paying for wherever I want but I understand that this is the way these services are going.  I'll just try to enjoy The Mandolorian on my desktop for now while I ponder upgrading my hardware.
I have a 2017 Samsung TV and I was able to download the app but whenever I try to watch something it‚Äôs just a blank screen and nothing ever comes up. TV shows will bring me to the show page but when I try to play one it‚Äôll play with sound but no picture. Is this just something that happens because of all the people trying watch at once or is there something wrong with my app?

Edit: I forgot that I could get the app on the PlayStation so I did that and it works just fine. I think it‚Äôs an app issue with the Samsung TVs.
Hi

Am wondering if anyone can give me some advice / education on Smart TV's.

Our current home setup is Kodi installed on an old Amazon Fire TV box which is streaming ready trans-coded MKV files of the home server.

We have purchased a Samsung Smart TV (well nearly a year ago) which can have Plex installed on it which I have often given thought of moving over to.

What is the security like on these devices as I am concerned about a TV being connected to the WiFi and by definition the internet and having access to the home server.

I know it sounds stupid considering the Amazon Boxes are on the network without firewalls and anti-virus software which took me a while to get comfortable with so am struggling with the thought of the TV being on WiFi.

Any advice would be great.

Thanks

Paul
Google have a weird trade in phone list. For example on Samsung phone list, they don't even list Note 9 or Note 10 but they do have Note 8 and older phone models.

I am hoping i can get a samaung gear on black Friday but there are a few different models and The frontier keeps catching my eye. Is the s3 frontier any good? Or would a different model be better
I am wanting to upgrade my 2015 retina MacBook Pro to a 1tb EVO SSD, I understand that I will need an M.2 adaptor. The thing is, I primarily use Bootcamp, will I run to issues if I was to clone my entire Bootcamp partition from my Apple SSD to the Samsung EVO one?
I have a issue. I am currently with a 1tb hard drive split in half with os x and win 7 via bootcamp. I am downgrading space to a 512gb samsung evo ssd, so I am wondering whats the process to clone my setup?

Would winclone be the answer? Thanks in advance!
My build as of now consists of the following:

I will be using this build for general use, gaming, and some deep learning (nothing overly intensive as I can ssh into my uni's supercomputers for balls deep networks).

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 1080p 144hz monitor which I will be running my games at (for now), and no need for an optical drive. I am purchasing parts in the US, and would like the budget to hover around the same price.

&amp;#x200B;

I am concerned about the comparability note at the bottom of the pcpartpicker linked site, any recommendations on this? I am considering going a full 1tb ssd, perhaps with a cheaper alternative than the Samsung 860 evo. Flexible on mobo and RAM, if a better alternative presents itself. I also just chose a random case, and would love to hear your favorite cases under $100.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think? Let me know before I drop hella cash on this. Honest feedback is much appreciated.

anyone else got scre**d over? 

it takes over 30 seconds for the system to post and then around 7 minutes for the GRUB menu to show. This is with fast boot enabled in the bios; if I disable fast boot, I get stuck at loading initial ramdisk.

Tried various options in the BIOS like loading safe defaults etc but can't seem to nail this one down.
I have a Roku Ultra connected to a Vizio M TV and D+ only gives me HD and 5.1 Tried more than one input and HDMI cable.

I also have another Roku Ultra connected to a Samsung NU8000 that shows HDR, ATMOS, 4k...the whole deal.

Why can‚Äôt I get even 4k on the Vizio setup? The TV also supports up HDR and DOLBY VIZION. 

Weird. Help me, Obi Wan?
Hi there.

I would like to ask which of the mobile phones is better to buy? Which would you buy and for what reasons? What are the pros and cons of these mobiles? What cell phone is more profitable to buy and why? Does Samsung pay more for a brand, or is it really better (regardless of price) than Xiaomi? Is it worth buying Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Pro instead of Samsung Galaxy Note10 +?

Samsung ($ 1120) or Xiaomi ($ 690)?

Thanks.

Hello, just hoping for some tips and advice on my first PC build, I don‚Äôt really know too much about the parts and the compatibility of them all and how they match up with the space/slot in the tower case and which parts parts get me the best value for money etc.
This is a budget build so I‚Äôm hoping to keep to less than ¬£900, and hopefully I can pick the parts up in the sale for a total of less than ¬£800. I‚Äôm from the UK btw, and I‚Äôve already got a keyboard and mouse.

I want to be able to run Fortnite at a consistent 144 FPS, don‚Äôt mind if this is on low settings of course, and am planning on buying these parts from Amazon.

Any help and advice on telling me if they all work together and if I‚Äôve got the best vfm, best place to get them from, any tips on putting them together etc would be very welcome and greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

I didn't realise that Realme is a branch of OPPO. The Indian market is certainly heating up and it looks like Xiaomi and Oppo are killing it.
I ran into this issue last night after my system was 'hibernated' for about 24 hours. First time ever. Do you guys have input? System specs are below. I don't overclock anything other than the ram, just use turbo boost. But I am using the XMP profile for my RAM going to ddr4-3200 at 1.38v all controlled via XMP. This system has been stable since February 2019.

Please ... help :D I haven't slept for like a month trying to make my PC work as intended for 1500 EUR pc ...

**UPDATE6:** Adding some **CPU usages and latency screenshots during actual gaming** (ESO and AC:Origins as those are the only games on me atm after like 50th windows reinstall ...)  [https://prnt.sc/pw5g7e](https://prnt.sc/pw5g7e) \- latency,  [https://prnt.sc/pw5gcf](https://prnt.sc/pw5gcf) \- cpu usage during AC: Origins,  [https://prnt.sc/pw5gvi](https://prnt.sc/pw5gvi) \- cpu usage during AC: Origins (close up look on first 6 cores),  [https://prnt.sc/pw5h7o](https://prnt.sc/pw5h7o)  \- cpu usage while playing ESO ... I see lots of threads and latency (well all the latency) coming from system kernel ... Any ideas what it might be? I guess some drivers, but is there a way to get to know which? (already tried disabling all the usb I don't use, lan and audio card - and not just drivers, in bios even ...) .. **maybe chipset drivers suck?** Can't find newer than September ... forgot to make frametime screenshot, but it is a "rollercoaster" .. ms ingame jumping from 15ms all the way up to 100ms ...

**UPDATE5:** suddenly started getting **crackling sound on all devices** (monitor speakers, 2.1 logitech speakers and hyperx cloud 2 headset) when clicking on stuff, opening apps, changing volume etc... nothing except for some windows defender updates went through ....

**UPDATE4: tried using latencymon** instead of dpclat and these are the results! **terrible!** I browsed the net tho and did not find any solution ... :/ hopefully 1909 windows will fix this. I blame it on windows :D as I found several topics about 1903 causing stutters and freesync not working ... (**will try downgrading to 1809**) these are my findings (during 3dmark):  [https://prnt.sc/pvkodn](https://prnt.sc/pvkodn) ,  [https://prnt.sc/pvkohv](https://prnt.sc/pvkohv) Because now that I think about it my old PC was at 1803 even and all was smooth as hell ... **UPDATE:** todays 1909 update helped nothing unfortunately ...

CONCLUSION

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup. Check for BIOS updates. 

LatencyMon has been analyzing your system for  0:07:18  (h:mm:ss) on all processors.

The interrupt to process latency reflects the measured interval that a usermode process needed to respond to a hardware request from the moment the interrupt service routine started execution. This includes the scheduling and execution of a DPC routine, the signaling of an event and the waking up of a usermode thread from an idle wait state in response to that event.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hard pagefaults are events that get triggered by making use of virtual memory that is not resident in RAM but backed by a memory mapped file on disk. The process of resolving the hard pagefault requires reading in the memory from disk while the process is interrupted and blocked from execution.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: some processes were hit by hard pagefaults. If these were programs producing audio, they are likely to interrupt the audio stream resulting in dropouts, clicks and pops. Check the Processes tab to see which programs were hit.

**UPDATE3:** tried **Project Mercury** (simplified process lasso) to disable SMT conflict and jumping CCX. At first it gave me insane FPS boost! And I mean like 30% or more but did not fix the stutter. The next day it lowered FPS instead ... bamboozled ...

**UPDATE2:** all **synthetic benchmarks are running smooth** as hell, **GPU usage at 99%**, all looks good. Actually playing some **games** tho even when the **FPS is low, like 40FPS ... the GPU refuses to run at 99% ... it jumps between 30-70%**. It only keeps clock during benchmarks. It seems like all my **games are trying to to run on CPU and ignoring GPU ...**

**UPDATE1:** **latest ASUS bios** finally let me change **pci-e lanes to gen3, it did not help tho**. Everything is still super choppy. What still helps the most is using resolution scaling or VSR and setting ingame resolution to 8k even. For some reason it makes everything much smoother. Tried playing ESO for example and it is unplayable at my resolution. **At 8k it even gets more FPS and it looks much smoother LOL**... Some fps drops remain smooth even tho they are by 20, some fps drops cause micro freeze that you want to cry tho (so so working Freesync?)... still ... making the game run at 8k etc forces GPU to be at max usage so it lifts load from CPU and it becomes muuuuuch smoother. So either my ryzen **3600 is broken, or it's just crap CPU?** :D bottlenecking my GPU hard ... OR it's the ram ... because I have seen some ram comparisons and some ram had insane frametime spikes while at the same avarage FPS as some other rams being completely stable ... and frametime is my issue. It jumps by 100ms during stutters... **Asus bios version 2404 (agesa 1.0.0.4b)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What I tried so far according to comments: (ty so much for trying to help!)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Using 2 pci-e cables** \- 1 for 8 pin 1 for 6 pin - 0 improvement. Also changed positions for all PCI-e and SATA cables to different slots. **UPDATE: It got so much WORSE! GPU now never holds its clock, no matter the settings, games are crashing, amd adrenaline is crashing with them, monitor is crashing and turning off for 2-3 sec.** Well ... at least I think this is the issue out of the changes I made.  [https://prnt.sc/pot507](https://prnt.sc/pot507) seems to hold it okay in AIDA tho.

For example AC: origins went from 70FPS on ultra to 40 FPS ultra -&gt; low. No matter the settings. And this is what the graph looks like while playing it (or trying to)  [https://prnt.sc/potcbv](https://prnt.sc/potcbv) Also when alt-tabbing from game now it just turns white and has to be turned off using task manager. WTF? o.O

**Setting -50% power draw** on GPU - results in GPU running at 1300Mhz thus always being at 100% usage in demanding games =&gt; same results as using resolution scaling to force 100% usage on GPU - only fixes it in benchmarks =&gt; **no PSU issue?**

**Found stable manual CPU OC** \- 4.2Ghz all cores at 1.3625v with PBO disabled - with PBO enabled PC won't boot with these settings - *20-ish% improvement* \- last time I managed to get 3.95 with PBO enabled and voltage set to auto - anything above resulted in PC not booting - same-ish improvement. But rather using bios default for now. Even tho this manul OC gives me 300 more points in 3D mark ....

**Memory bandwith tested with Aida94:**

Aida64 cache and memory bench =&gt; [https://prnt.sc/popq2r](https://prnt.sc/popq2r)

Aida64 memory read bench: 51461 MB/s

Aida64 memory write bench: 28745 MB/s

Aida64 memory copy bench: 48905 MB/s

Aida64 latency bench: 68,7 ns

**Changed RAM from slot 2 and 4 to slot 1 and 3** \- took like 3 restarts to boot up, before the PC just light up but no display, no keyboard and mouse were working -&gt; put them back to slot 2 and 4

**Tightening GPU backplate screws** \- 0 improvement

**DPC latency tested:**  [https://prnt.sc/pophrk](https://prnt.sc/pophrk) never gets under 1000 and to green values

**60Hz vs 75Hz** set on the monitor as well as **HDMI/DP** cable (even bought new one going from 1.2DP to 1.4DP with golden connectors) and **FreeSync OFF/ON** \- 0 improvement

**My MB has 0 settings for PCIE** in BIOS - just to enable/disable virtualization =&gt; can't try PCIE3 - **GPU-z shows PCIE1.1 when on desktop and PCIE4 when using it's benchmark**

**OC + undervolt x UC + undervolt x defaults** on each component one by one or together =&gt; difference in temps, stutters remain

**Checked MB QVL** \- last update is from the day it got released and has nearly no components listed, not even the GPU or anything (**ASUS prime x570-p**)

**Tried updating AHCI-SATA drivers**: going from standard windows drivers to AMD ones result in infinite windows loading screen

**Tried affinity for cores 6-12 and also disabling SMT** (in cases it jumps across cores) - 0 improvement. Or maybe it just did not stop it from jumping across cores?

**New observation 1**: When alt-tabbing from game to desktop or the other way around, it blinks. Like ... desktop blinks into the game before stablizing, same goes the other way around and the same happens when opening apps for example opening chrome: it appears, right after it appears it blinks black and white and stabilizes. Also when values change in monitoring SW like GPU-u or HWinfo64 they don't just change, they blink a little white before appearing.

**"New" observation 2:** It's the first load of something that is stuttering in apps - all AMD adrenaline tabs (gaming, video, system etc.) stutter the first time they are opened. Like insane choppy rollout and CPU spikes to highest possible clock - when opened the second time they are not choppy anymore and CPU stays at base 3.6Ghz. Same happens with ingame benchmark for example. The first time you turn it on, it starts choppy for a second. Like really low FPS (10-20) before it gets up to normal FPS. The second time I turn it on - starts at normal FPS

**ORIGINAL POST:**

**Rig: (2 weeks old, brand new)**

**GPU:** Sapphire Pulse RX 5700XT  / *previously RX 480 XFX Black Edition*

**CPU:** Ryzen 5 3600 (PBO + Auto OC) / *Previously i5 6600k @4.8Ghz OC*

**PSU:** 650W Seasonic focus plus gold / *Previously EVGA 650GS*

**RAM:** CL 16 3600Mhz crucial ballistix sport / *Previously Corsair Vengeance 3200Mhz 16CL*

**MB:** Asus x570 prime-p / *Previously AsRock Fatality Gaming K6 Z170*

**Case:** Fractal Meshify C / *Previously NZXT elite s340*

**Case fans:** 2x Noctua 140PWM + 2x Noctua 120PWM / *Previously "similiar setup"*

**CPU cooler:** Mugen Scythe 5 RevB / *Previously NZXT Kraken x42*

**SSD:** 1TB Crucial mx500 / *Previously Samsung EVO 850 250gb + WD Blue EX 1TB*

**Monitor:** LG 29um-68p Freesync capable (40-75Hz range) 2560x1080 - same

**Windows 10** build 1903 / *Previously 1803 or 1809* / + AMD Adrenalin 19.10.1 (going from 19.9 it fixed flickering on 75 Hz screens with freesync enabled) with latest chipset driver and latest MB Bios

&amp;#x200B;

For 3 years my old rig was smooth as butter. Not a single stutter. Ever. Not even with huge drops during explosions from 60 to 30 FPS (FreeSync range changed with CRU to 30-75Hz). But after I sell it because of lower FPS and buy a new one it is way worse? :O

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue:**

**Bad performance in all games** (even tho with vsync off and no limiter this rig plays newest AAA games all maxed at 80 FPS+) and **all aplications =&gt; microfreezes** when browsing, opening apps, scrolling through AMD adrenaline tabs (screen, games, etc.), microfreezes in game during anything =&gt; actually playing the game, just browsing inventory, changing tabs (map, quests, side quests etc.)

**Full system freeze when something outside of the game occurs** =&gt; controller disconnected, discord message, steam friend comes online =&gt; in game drop to 1-2 FPS for 1-2 seconds till it gets back to normal.

**Microfreezes/stuttering** happens even if the game is limited and kept **at steady 60 or 75 fps or whatever value W/O even dropping** =&gt; **imput lag jumps** from 16ms to 80-100ms when stuttering occurs and make the whole system go crazy - **SSD usage spikes** (from 5-10% to 50-60%), **CPU usually drops PBO 4.192 GHz and drops to 3.5 Ghz**, **Ethernet card download jumps to 20mb/s+** even tho after monitoring it there is no application downloading anything.

**Freesync** is of course **ON** in both monitor settings and AMD adrenaline

**Textures** in games sometimes **pop up** =&gt; instead of smooth transition when something moves it sometimes just a position where it is supposed to end - for example clothes moving in the wind

**Stutters** happen **with every autosave** in game, **with every starting cutscene** or during (cutscenes in AC:Origins even tho shown to be max FPS actually look like 5-ish FPS =&gt; slideshow jumping sections by 2 seconds instead of fluid video)

&amp;#x200B;

**What I tried so far:**

**Fresh W10** installation with **fresh 19.10.1 AMD drivers** \- 0 improvement

**Disabled everything in W10** that might be the cause: **DVR, gamebar, fullscreen optimization, exploit protection, unnecessary services etc.** \- *0 improvement*

**Disabled parking** and set Turbo boost and Frequency index with QuickCPU to 100% - *0 improvement*

**Disabled PBO and instead used manual OC** to 3.95 (anything above was unstable) to get rid of clocks jumping up and down - approx. **20% reduction in stutters**

**Tried RAM** at default settings without XMP, tried RAM at XMP, tried RAM with custom timings - *0 improvements*

**Setting game priority** from normal to high in both task manager and in registry - *0 improvement*

**Tried all combinations of sync** \- vsync on/off/enhanced + limiter 2 fps under max refresh rate/witout limiter + freesync on/off etc. - all the same, **everything stutters**

**Tried ISLC** to automatically clean system memory if standby list exceeds 1024MB and free memory gets lower than 2048MB

**Tried** setting ingame **upscalling to 120-200%** =&gt; forcing GPU to run at 100% usage at all times and stop it from fluctuating - **99.9% reduction of stutters BUT IN BENCHMARKS ONLY :(** \- used to be choppy as hell in all game benchmarks, with upscalling ultra buttery smooth as long as it makes GPU cry.  **Actual gameplay stutters reduced by 15-20%** =======&gt; at first it looked like ryzen 3600 is insane bottleneck so GPU at 100% fixes it and made me so happy before I tried actual gameplay.

**Removing** 1 stick of **ram** then the other, **changing ram** slots - *0 improvement*

**Changing all cables** from PSU - *0 improvement*

**Running CHKDSK, MemTest, Aida64** stability test, **Unigine Heaven, Cinebech R20, 3DMark** for hours - **0 issues found** \- even under stress tests temperature on **CPU under 65C, GPU under 65C overall and 75C junction, chipset tops at 66C**. Unfortunately **NEW X570 ASUS BOARDS GOT VRM HIDDEN!!!** But I chose x570 prime-p directly because of benchmakrs showing it is the best cooled MB of them all even amongst expensive ones so I hope *MY* VRMs are not "in hell" :D

PS: while typing this topic I got a **little freeze** twice which resulted in the text fast forward appearing a bit later and noticed a liiiiittle tiny **spike in CPU usage - approx. 5%** and as well as boost in clock then right back. Also while this happened I heard a feint sqreeching sound. This happened for the first time ever tho... and keeps happening whenever I open an app or something.

**Feelings :D** ... I have not played without buttery smooth working freesync for years ... idk if this is just **Freesync** not working and people who don't have it so far are enduring this terrible experience :D but to me atm ... it is a waste of 1500 euro ... what is 9999 FPS good for when it looks like 3 ...

**PLEASE if anyone has similiar issues and has some suggestions or FOUND THE FIX let me (and others reading this topic) know.**

**Cheers!**
I need a powerful computer that could run games on ultra 1440p at 60 hz at least, im a starter so idk a lot about this, can i make this cheaper? obviously without making it worst, this would be a computer for videogames, 3d stuff like autocad 3d and video editing.

My budget is 1600 usd max, and if you can include mouse and keyboard that fits on the budget, ill fricking love you.

It‚Äôs loose when I plug a charging cable in. Idk what to do. I haven‚Äôt tried anything so far except make a post here. Model code is NP530E5M-X03US
My motherboard is slowly dying out on me (RAM slots are losing functionality) so it looks like I'll need to make an upgrade soon. My current system uses a LGA1150 CPU socket which I'm aware is kinda outdated nowadays. I play relatively graphically intense games and a little bit of vr on the side. I haven't kept up to date on the current meta of CPUs and mobos. What should I invest in with $400 to keep my system on the road for the next few years?

I've been doing a lot of research, and I'm very excited for my very first build! I thought it would be good to get some final feedback from the community before I start buying my parts. I managed to put this list together at right around the $1,000 range with the goal of getting decent gaming performance at 1080p. I mostly play sandbox and simulation games (Factorio, Rimworld, Cities: Skylines, Minecraft) but also hope to run more demanding AAA titles on occasion (Cyberpunk 2077 when it comes out). I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or constructive feedback! Here it is:

Additional questions I have:  
\-I've been reading about incompatibilities between certain motherboards and 3rd generation Ryzen. I believe this one is compatible, but would anyone be able to confirm this?  
\-I chose a relatively cheap SSD that still seems reputable. Is it worth considering a more expensive model like the Samsung 860 or 970, or should this be good enough?  
\-Are there any other potential compatibility issues I should be aware of? For example, will this SSD work with my motherboard?

As you can tell, I'm brand new to this, so I may respond with questions. Thank you for your help!

I need a powerful computer that could run games on ultra 1440p at 60 hz at least, im a starter so idk a lot about this, can i make this cheaper? obviously without making it worst, this would be a computer for videogames, 3d stuff like autocad 3d and video editing.

My budget is 1600 usd max, and if you can include mouse and keyboard that fits on the budget, ill fricking love you.

My motherboard is slowly dying out on me (RAM slots are losing functionality) so it looks like I'll need to make an upgrade soon. My current system uses a LGA1150 CPU socket which I'm aware is kinda outdated nowadays. I play relatively graphically intense games and a little bit of vr on the side. I haven't kept up to date on the current meta of CPUs and mobos. What should I invest in with $400 to keep my system on the road for the next few years?

Hello, sorry for reposting, but the topic died and noone is reacting or reading new updates (I marked them 1-6). Please ... help :D I haven't slept for like a month trying to make my PC work as intended for 1500 EUR pc ...

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE6:** Adding some **CPU usages and latency screenshots during actual gaming** (ESO and AC:Origins as those are the only games on me atm after like 50th windows reinstall ...)  [https://prnt.sc/pw5g7e](https://prnt.sc/pw5g7e) \- latency,  [https://prnt.sc/pw5gcf](https://prnt.sc/pw5gcf) \- cpu usage during AC: Origins,  [https://prnt.sc/pw5gvi](https://prnt.sc/pw5gvi) \- cpu usage during AC: Origins (close up look on first 6 cores),  [https://prnt.sc/pw5h7o](https://prnt.sc/pw5h7o)  \- cpu usage while playing ESO ... I see lots of threads and latency (well all the latency) coming from system kernel ... Any ideas what it might be? I guess some drivers, but is there a way to get to know which? (already tried disabling all the usb I don't use, lan and audio card - and not just drivers, in bios even ...) .. **maybe chipset drivers suck?** Can't find newer than September ... forgot to make frametime screenshot, but it is a "rollercoaster" .. ms ingame jumping from 15ms all the way up to 100ms ...

**UPDATE5:** suddenly started getting **crackling sound on all devices** (monitor speakers, 2.1 logitech speakers and hyperx cloud 2 headset) when clicking on stuff, opening apps, changing volume etc... nothing except for some windows defender updates went through ....

**UPDATE4: tried using latencymon** instead of dpclat and these are the results! **terrible!** I browsed the net tho and did not find any solution ... :/ hopefully 1909 windows will fix this. I blame it on windows :D as I found several topics about 1903 causing stutters and freesync not working ... (**will try downgrading to 1809**) these are my findings (during 3dmark):  [https://prnt.sc/pvkodn](https://prnt.sc/pvkodn) ,  [https://prnt.sc/pvkohv](https://prnt.sc/pvkohv) Because now that I think about it my old PC was at 1803 even and all was smooth as hell ... **UPDATE:** todays 1909 update helped nothing unfortunately ...

CONCLUSION

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup. Check for BIOS updates. 

LatencyMon has been analyzing your system for  0:07:18  (h:mm:ss) on all processors.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The interrupt to process latency reflects the measured interval that a usermode process needed to respond to a hardware request from the moment the interrupt service routine started execution. This includes the scheduling and execution of a DPC routine, the signaling of an event and the waking up of a usermode thread from an idle wait state in response to that event.

 REPORTED HARD PAGEFAULTS

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hard pagefaults are events that get triggered by making use of virtual memory that is not resident in RAM but backed by a memory mapped file on disk. The process of resolving the hard pagefault requires reading in the memory from disk while the process is interrupted and blocked from execution.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: some processes were hit by hard pagefaults. If these were programs producing audio, they are likely to interrupt the audio stream resulting in dropouts, clicks and pops. Check the Processes tab to see which programs were hit.

**UPDATE3:** tried **Project Mercury** (simplified process lasso) to disable SMT conflict and jumping CCX. At first it gave me insane FPS boost! And I mean like 30% or more but did not fix the stutter. The next day it lowered FPS instead ... bamboozled ...

**UPDATE2:** all **synthetic benchmarks are running smooth** as hell, **GPU usage at 99%**, all looks good. Actually playing some **games** tho even when the **FPS is low, like 40FPS ... the GPU refuses to run at 99% ... it jumps between 30-70%**. It only keeps clock during benchmarks. It seems like all my **games are trying to to run on CPU and ignoring GPU ...**

**UPDATE1:** **latest ASUS bios** finally let me change **pci-e lanes to gen3, it did not help tho**. Everything is still super choppy. What still helps the most is using resolution scaling or VSR and setting ingame resolution to 8k even. For some reason it makes everything much smoother. Tried playing ESO for example and it is unplayable at my resolution. **At 8k it even gets more FPS and it looks much smoother LOL**... Some fps drops remain smooth even tho they are by 20, some fps drops cause micro freeze that you want to cry tho (so so working Freesync?)... still ... making the game run at 8k etc forces GPU to be at max usage so it lifts load from CPU and it becomes muuuuuch smoother. So either my ryzen **3600 is broken, or it's just crap CPU?** :D bottlenecking my GPU hard ... OR it's the ram ... because I have seen some ram comparisons and some ram had insane frametime spikes while at the same avarage FPS as some other rams being completely stable ... and frametime is my issue. It jumps by 100ms during stutters... **Asus bios version 2404 (agesa 1.0.0.4b)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What I tried so far according to comments: (ty so much for trying to help!)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Using 2 pci-e cables** \- 1 for 8 pin 1 for 6 pin - 0 improvement. Also changed positions for all PCI-e and SATA cables to different slots. **UPDATE: It got so much WORSE! GPU now never holds its clock, no matter the settings, games are crashing, amd adrenaline is crashing with them, monitor is crashing and turning off for 2-3 sec.** Well ... at least I think this is the issue out of the changes I made.  [https://prnt.sc/pot507](https://prnt.sc/pot507) seems to hold it okay in AIDA tho.

For example AC: origins went from 70FPS on ultra to 40 FPS ultra -&gt; low. No matter the settings. And this is what the graph looks like while playing it (or trying to)  [https://prnt.sc/potcbv](https://prnt.sc/potcbv) Also when alt-tabbing from game now it just turns white and has to be turned off using task manager. WTF? o.O

**Setting -50% power draw** on GPU - results in GPU running at 1300Mhz thus always being at 100% usage in demanding games =&gt; same results as using resolution scaling to force 100% usage on GPU - only fixes it in benchmarks =&gt; **no PSU issue?**

**Found stable manual CPU OC** \- 4.2Ghz all cores at 1.3625v with PBO disabled - with PBO enabled PC won't boot with these settings - *20-ish% improvement* \- last time I managed to get 3.95 with PBO enabled and voltage set to auto - anything above resulted in PC not booting - same-ish improvement. But rather using bios default for now. Even tho this manul OC gives me 300 more points in 3D mark ....

**Memory bandwith tested with Aida94:**

Aida64 cache and memory bench =&gt; [https://prnt.sc/popq2r](https://prnt.sc/popq2r)

Aida64 memory read bench: 51461 MB/s

Aida64 memory write bench: 28745 MB/s

Aida64 memory copy bench: 48905 MB/s

Aida64 latency bench: 68,7 ns

**Changed RAM from slot 2 and 4 to slot 1 and 3** \- took like 3 restarts to boot up, before the PC just light up but no display, no keyboard and mouse were working -&gt; put them back to slot 2 and 4

**Tightening GPU backplate screws** \- 0 improvement

**DPC latency tested:**  [https://prnt.sc/pophrk](https://prnt.sc/pophrk) never gets under 1000 and to green values

**60Hz vs 75Hz** set on the monitor as well as **HDMI/DP** cable (even bought new one going from 1.2DP to 1.4DP with golden connectors) and **FreeSync OFF/ON** \- 0 improvement

**My MB has 0 settings for PCIE** in BIOS - just to enable/disable virtualization =&gt; can't try PCIE3 - **GPU-z shows PCIE1.1 when on desktop and PCIE4 when using it's benchmark**

**OC + undervolt x UC + undervolt x defaults** on each component one by one or together =&gt; difference in temps, stutters remain

**Checked MB QVL** \- last update is from the day it got released and has nearly no components listed, not even the GPU or anything (**ASUS prime x570-p**)

**Tried updating AHCI-SATA drivers**: going from standard windows drivers to AMD ones result in infinite windows loading screen

**Tried affinity for cores 6-12 and also disabling SMT** (in cases it jumps across cores) - 0 improvement. Or maybe it just did not stop it from jumping across cores?

**New observation 1**: When alt-tabbing from game to desktop or the other way around, it blinks. Like ... desktop blinks into the game before stablizing, same goes the other way around and the same happens when opening apps for example opening chrome: it appears, right after it appears it blinks black and white and stabilizes. Also when values change in monitoring SW like GPU-u or HWinfo64 they don't just change, they blink a little white before appearing.

**"New" observation 2:** It's the first load of something that is stuttering in apps - all AMD adrenaline tabs (gaming, video, system etc.) stutter the first time they are opened. Like insane choppy rollout and CPU spikes to highest possible clock - when opened the second time they are not choppy anymore and CPU stays at base 3.6Ghz. Same happens with ingame benchmark for example. The first time you turn it on, it starts choppy for a second. Like really low FPS (10-20) before it gets up to normal FPS. The second time I turn it on - starts at normal FPS

**Windows 10** build 1903 / *Previously 1803 or 1809* / + AMD Adrenalin 19.10.1 (going from 19.9 it fixed flickering on 75 Hz screens with freesync enabled) with latest chipset driver and latest MB Bios

&amp;#x200B;

For 3 years my old rig was smooth as butter. Not a single stutter. Ever. Not even with huge drops during explosions from 60 to 30 FPS (FreeSync range changed with CRU to 30-75Hz). But after I sell it because of lower FPS and buy a new one it is way worse? :O

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue:**

**Bad performance in all games** (even tho with vsync off and no limiter this rig plays newest AAA games all maxed at 80 FPS+) and **all aplications =&gt; microfreezes** when browsing, opening apps, scrolling through AMD adrenaline tabs (screen, games, etc.), microfreezes in game during anything =&gt; actually playing the game, just browsing inventory, changing tabs (map, quests, side quests etc.)

**Full system freeze when something outside of the game occurs** =&gt; controller disconnected, discord message, steam friend comes online =&gt; in game drop to 1-2 FPS for 1-2 seconds till it gets back to normal.

**Microfreezes/stuttering** happens even if the game is limited and kept **at steady 60 or 75 fps or whatever value W/O even dropping** =&gt; **imput lag jumps** from 16ms to 80-100ms when stuttering occurs and make the whole system go crazy - **SSD usage spikes** (from 5-10% to 50-60%), **CPU usually drops PBO 4.192 GHz and drops to 3.5 Ghz**, **Ethernet card download jumps to 20mb/s+** even tho after monitoring it there is no application downloading anything.

**Freesync** is of course **ON** in both monitor settings and AMD adrenaline

**Textures** in games sometimes **pop up** =&gt; instead of smooth transition when something moves it sometimes just a position where it is supposed to end - for example clothes moving in the wind

**Stutters** happen **with every autosave** in game, **with every starting cutscene** or during (cutscenes in AC:Origins even tho shown to be max FPS actually look like 5-ish FPS =&gt; slideshow jumping sections by 2 seconds instead of fluid video)

&amp;#x200B;

**What I tried so far:**

**Fresh W10** installation with **fresh 19.10.1 AMD drivers** \- 0 improvement

**Disabled everything in W10** that might be the cause: **DVR, gamebar, fullscreen optimization, exploit protection, unnecessary services etc.** \- *0 improvement*

**Disabled parking** and set Turbo boost and Frequency index with QuickCPU to 100% - *0 improvement*

**Disabled PBO and instead used manual OC** to 3.95 (anything above was unstable) to get rid of clocks jumping up and down - approx. **20% reduction in stutters**

**Tried RAM** at default settings without XMP, tried RAM at XMP, tried RAM with custom timings - *0 improvements*

**Setting game priority** from normal to high in both task manager and in registry - *0 improvement*

**Tried all combinations of sync** \- vsync on/off/enhanced + limiter 2 fps under max refresh rate/witout limiter + freesync on/off etc. - all the same, **everything stutters**

**Tried ISLC** to automatically clean system memory if standby list exceeds 1024MB and free memory gets lower than 2048MB

**Tried** setting ingame **upscalling to 120-200%** =&gt; forcing GPU to run at 100% usage at all times and stop it from fluctuating - **99.9% reduction of stutters BUT IN BENCHMARKS ONLY :(** \- used to be choppy as hell in all game benchmarks, with upscalling ultra buttery smooth as long as it makes GPU cry.  **Actual gameplay stutters reduced by 15-20%** =======&gt; at first it looked like ryzen 3600 is insane bottleneck so GPU at 100% fixes it and made me so happy before I tried actual gameplay.

**Removing** 1 stick of **ram** then the other, **changing ram** slots - *0 improvement*

**Changing all cables** from PSU - *0 improvement*

**Running CHKDSK, MemTest, Aida64** stability test, **Unigine Heaven, Cinebech R20, 3DMark** for hours - **0 issues found** \- even under stress tests temperature on **CPU under 65C, GPU under 65C overall and 75C junction, chipset tops at 66C**. Unfortunately **NEW X570 ASUS BOARDS GOT VRM HIDDEN!!!** But I chose x570 prime-p directly because of benchmakrs showing it is the best cooled MB of them all even amongst expensive ones so I hope *MY* VRMs are not "in hell" :D

PS: while typing this topic I got a **little freeze** twice which resulted in the text fast forward appearing a bit later and noticed a liiiiittle tiny **spike in CPU usage - approx. 5%** and as well as boost in clock then right back. Also while this happened I heard a feint sqreeching sound. This happened for the first time ever tho... and keeps happening whenever I open an app or something.

**Feelings :D** ... I have not played without buttery smooth working freesync for years ... idk if this is just **Freesync** not working and people who don't have it so far are enduring this terrible experience :D but to me atm ... it is a waste of 1500 euro ... what is 9999 FPS good for when it looks like 3 ...

**PLEASE if anyone has similiar issues and has some suggestions or FOUND THE FIX let me (and others reading this topic) know.**

**Cheers!**
I have a samsung un65hu7250f and over the course of the past year or so I have noticed that they have pretty much stopped support of the smart tv apps first they removed the wwe app and now no support for disney plus. This is pretty aggervating due to this tv really not being that old. Is there anyway to manually add apps to this tv or if anything upgrade the system os.

Both my PS4 Pro in my Samsung TV can handle 4K but when I go to the 4K UHD section and pick a movie but the movie only says HD in the description is there any way to actually tell if it's 4K. I would think in the description it would actually say 4K if it was going to stream in 4k
Both the app on the Samsung TV and PS4 Pro say the same thing

Thanks

**Monitor one**

[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Predator-Z35P-bmiphz-3440x1440/dp/B07BDQNDKY?th=1)

**Monitor two**

[Very long amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-32-Inch-Curved-Monitor-LC32JG56QQNXZA/dp/B07R6YFTYF/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=1440p+WQHD+monitor&amp;qid=1573604845&amp;refinements=p_n_feature_eleven_browse-bin%3A17726573011%7C17726574011%7C17726575011%7C17726576011%2Cp_n_size_browse-bin%3A3547808011%2Cp_n_feature_fourteen_browse-bin%3A17751789011&amp;rnid=17751784011&amp;s=pc&amp;sr=1-3)

&amp;#x200B;

I do have a GTX 1080 so no idea if AMD freesync actually works or not with it. There was some kind of event happened this year that makes it seem like it could.

Both monitors are

* 1440p
* 144hz
* 30 inches or higher and curved (which was a must and ruled out [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZXZ3QBD/ref=psdc_1292115011_t1_B07BDQNDKY?th=1).

I'm thinking maybe monitor one since the reviews are great for the colors on it which is a very important factor to me. Monitor 2 I have no idea what it's colors are like. Monitor 1 however I don't know the contrast ratio or how good the darks and lights are.
So here's the deal.

i switched to rogers from my old provider because i got a 20% discount at the time. had to constantly call in to have the discount added back because each month it'd be "magically accidentally removed". I no longer work for the company that was giving me that discount so i no longer have it. i knew my bill would go up, but not this much.

Me and my sister are on the same plan. we have 2 pohones and 2 tablets. none of these are paid off :

&amp;#x200B;

x1 Samsung S10, on it's current plan costing, 140.00

x1 Iphone X on it's current plan costing 85.00

x1 Samsung Tab-A costing 22.50

x1 Ipad Costing 30.00

I figured everything with tax would be coming out to about \~300.00 or so, which is still really high as all hell. i understand that these device are not paid off , but the prices above are supposed to include the device cost as well. when i was on the discount it was around \~240 for all 4 devices which is not too terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

however, the bill keeps coming in as above \~400.00 this month it was \~410.00, before it was 480.00! there were some occasional text to family in the states and a single call that cost $8.00 that my sister made. but that's it. Rogers cannot tell me why the bill is as high as it is and will only say it's accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

they said to  switch us on to the unlimited plans to "save us money" but the plans cost the same amount as my old plans so there is no savings what so ever. I'm on 20, becasue i use my device alot at school and on the transit there. my sister is on the 10 gb.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes it even worse is that where i go to school (College) there is absolutely no rogers cell signal, and i'm there 50% of the day monday-friday. 10% of the time i get Emergency calls only, the rest it says No Service. "We don't have a tower in your area.", they say, so they tell me to use the school's wifi to do everything, which i cannot use because the transmission and security protocols the schools network uses do not work on my android device. so i'm paying for services that i can't even use more than half the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel trapped. i'm a college student and i can't just pay off these devices, yet i can't even use them. there's over 2000+ owing total on all 4 devices, although only 800 or so is mine, i still cannot just go pay them off. 

&amp;#x200B;

how can i go about lowering my bill? i hate to say this but i'll be leaving rogers if it cannot be lowered. yes i owe money still, buton an unrelated note, my mother fucked up my credit (which is for another story) so i already have bad credit. adding this to it would make much difference. eventually i would pay it off of course.

&amp;#x200B;

any ideas guys? thanks.
Hello ultrawidemasterrace fam! I'm in need of your assistance.

As the title suggests, is such a thing possible if I wanted to purchase two of these monitors in order to stack them with each other. I'm looking to buying two Ergotron HX desk mounts, but i dont think it would be high enough to mount them in a top and bottom configuration. The machine is currently running two 2080ti's so it should be good in the graphics department. In addition, I won't be looking to using a wall mount due to having a standing desk.

Thanks you in advanced! Fyi this is not for me. Wish it was though lol
So I have been working on this application. I have yet to get much of the backend working properly. I did the front end and now am trying to integrate the native part into the UI.

I have UI Layouts for both a tablet and phone. I have been using the tablet layout mostly due to ease. Today I went back to using the emulator while I was taking my son to a Dr. appointment. Now my app start crashing from the beginning. Not sure why.

Emulator is running 8.0

Here is the problem code (It does not crash here):

    val dir = createProjectFolder(this@MainActivity)
            if (dir != null) {
    
                val ex: InputStream = assets.open("ex.tgz");
                val proc = ProcessBuilder("tar", "-xzf", "-").directory(dir).start()
    
                try {
                    val buffer = ByteArray(4096);
    
                    fun pump(): Boolean {
                        val n = ex.read(buffer)
                        return n &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; proc.outputStream.write(buffer, 0, n).let { true }
                    }
    
                    while (pump()) {
                    }
                    proc.outputStream.close()
                } catch (e: IOException) {
                    Log.d("FOO", e.toString())
                }
    
                Log.e("FOO", "OUT: ${String(proc.inputStream.readBytes())}")
                Log.e("FOO", "ERR: ${String(proc.errorStream.readBytes())}")
    
                proc.waitFor()
    
                Log.d("FOO", "DONE")
            }

What is happening is that I am getting and IOException after about 8K of reading. The logical says: 

    D/FOO: java.io.IOException: write failed: EPIPE (Broken pipe)
    E/FOO: OUT: 
    E/FOO: ERR: tar: exec gunzip: Permission denied
        tar: read error
    D/FOO: DONE

So I figure that at some point along the way, I had some permission set that I inadvertently took out... but maybe not?!

I uninstalled the app on the tablet and ran it from scratch, everything worked fine still. 

I looked in the settings to see what permissions the app had: No Permission Required

Tablet is Samsung TAB A 2019 running Android 9.0

Phone is Samsung J7 2018 running Android 8.0

Emulator is Pixel 2 XL Running 8.0  


Is this a problem with Android 8? how can I fix it?
Hey guys.

My best friend and I both preordered 256G Verizon Note 10+ (she got the 5G).  From day 1, we've had strange battery issues.  At 10% and under, both devices die super fast.  Like, sometimes it will go from 7% to dead before you can plug it in.  We started charging it sooner and called it a day.

Recently, it now happens under 15%.

We don't leave them on chargers overnight or anything, we're not careless with them.  

Is anyone else having this issue?  I've talked to Samsung and they want me to factory reset because we've tried a handful of other methods to no avail.  I just don't want to do that.
Hello. Is this monitor any good? Do you recommend it for casual purposes and watching movies? I can get it used for 220usd. 

I'm from Uruguay and monitors here are super expensive and ips 2k and 27 inches Start at 600usd.
Any advice? Thanks
I was thinking about building a new PC to replace my existing one that I currently have (rocking a 4 yr old machine). 

I've got wiggle room to play with but was wanting a build at around $1200. Any thoughts or recommendations welcomed.

Samsung's 1tb 970 Evo is $70 more than other 1tb M.2 SSDs I can see, like the Crucial P1, WD Blue, or Intel 660p. Is Samsung's worth the extra? PcPartPicker has it listed with a 1gb cache which no others have, so that might be something.
What I've tried couple times is that face unlock works even if phone is upside down.. I wonder if samsung can give an update where you can hold phone upside down and still use for text, call, browse but just have to turn around for photos. Would be pretty handy. Just pickup however.
Basic info: running android 9 in a Samsung A10. **Twitter is updated.**

Can someone please help me with this issue ? It's been almost 2 months since it started happening. I need to wait 2\~ minutes for things to start loading when i open the normal app, when using Twitter lite or accessing it through a computer it works just fine, in other words this is not related to my internet connection.

I have searched about the issue and **a fair amount of people experienced similar problems**, but i can't find a goddamn solution that works.

There is one thing i noticed, sometimes if i enable "airplane mode" and disable sometimes it solves the issue for 2\~3 minutes, and then it starts to happen again. I'm assuming **this could be some problem with the app connecting properly, but clearly this is a problem that only happens in the normal app**, since the lite version is fine.

**All other apps on my phone are working normal**, including games, so this clearly isn't a performance related issue, after all i don't see any performance problems with the Twitter app, only what looks like a connection problem.

**I have tried**: reinstalling the app, clearing all the data from the app, reinstalling both apps, changing every config related to data on Twitter and checked everything on my phone that i could think of regarding data usage.

**Download using wifi IS ENABLED**. Btw i'll try to make a ticket or something, but i think the Twitter support will take a while to answer, and i might very well get a generic answer, so i'm also posting it here.
I just want a consistent frame rate on medium settings.
I mostly play Call of Duty Mobile and is preparing for the release of League of Legends mobile next year. I also play a lot of rhythm games so responsiveness and quality of the touh screen also matters.

Or, does other brands have similarly priced phones with a better chipset?

What I need is an AMOLED display, 3.5mm headphone jack, and a fairly decent camera. Doesn't need to be flagship level but not crap either. Should be priced similar to the A70s but not way higher. Otherwise I'd get a Pixel 3XL instead which I couldn't afford at the moment.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I could have gotten a Mi 9T Pro but I don't want a phone with popup camera. I don't mind bezels at all.
###Build Help/Ready:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**
Yes.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better**
I plan on using this build mostly for gaming and just as a regular pc to do everyday pc tasks. In terms of gaming I will be playing demanding AAA games such as COD, RDR2, OW, etc.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

I'm looking to game on the highest settings as I can possibly get. Like I said I'm new to pc in general so I don't know what's considered good in terms of game settings, framerate, etc, but I would like to game with the highest settings possible and get good framerates, etc.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

$2700 max. If it goes over it's still not out of the question though.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

The USA

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

First off, I already have an excellent keyboard, and mouse,so I don't need those in the list. I do however need a case so case suggestions are greatly appreciated! I also need a monitor but it will have it's own budget so it will not be included in the 2700 budget for the build. Again, any monitor recommendations are greatly appreciated! The second comment I have is about the motherboard. Most of this build features the latest or excellent parts for each category to ensure this PC will last me for at least a couple of years without needing to upgrade, however, I have read that the motherboard I have and motherboards at those prices in general are just overkill. Money isn't much of a problem, but is there a motherboard that does much of what the motherboard I have selected , but at a fraction of the price? Or is the motherboard I have right now the best motherboard for my build. Last thing, I want to include as much lighting in my pc as possible, so if yall could reccomend good rgb light strips, etc, that would be great. Thanks alot everyone!
I recently purchased a Pioneer VSX-834 receiver that supports 4K, HDR10, Dolby Atmos, and more. When I have my Xbox One X directly plugged into my TV (Samsung) and go to the Xbox settings and ‚Äú4K TV Details‚Äù I get green check marks everywhere aside from Dolby Vision.

When I connect through the new receiver I get:
Yellow ‚ÄúI‚Äù next to 4K 10-bit at 50, and 60 Hz. (Your TV set-up doesn‚Äôt support this, however apps can use 4K 8-bit).

Red X next to HDR10 Gaming. (Your TV setup doesn‚Äôt support HDR10 for gaming).

HDR10 for video works and has a green check mark. Still no Dolby Vision as well.

The unit clearly supports the settings, as does my TV, so what am I missing here?

Thanks!
I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. I use Google Photos on a daily basis, but whenever i open the app, i get an annoying 'app needs updating' notice. I go to the Google store, but it says my device isn't compatible with the newest updates.

How is it possible by phone is no longer compatible with the latest version of GP? I tried uninstalling/reinstalling, but no change. I tried side loading an updated apk, but the app won't open.

It seems crazy my 2015 Chromebook has the latest version, but my Note 8 doesn't...
I am one indecisive fucker so please just pick for me.
I want to make a few quick pointers.
1) The 3000mhz ram I already own and can't return so Im stuck with it.
2) I also own the overkill SSD but I will be buying an extra 1tb one as 500gb isn't enough.
3) I will be buying the rtx 2080 super but not the ones listed below, just added random ones.

Brother is buying a new 4K TV ( Samsung 75" Q70R ) 

He is using my old receiver ( Denon AVR-1713 )

I know this older receiver can not pass through 4K so he could not connect the cable box or 4K player to the receiver itself.  Would he be able to use ARC to play just the sound through the receiver if the cable box is connected to another port on the TV itself?

I can't believe I didn't consider this before I gave him my old Denon.  I would rather not have to buy him a new receiver if I can help it.

Thank you
I was looking for recommendations on server software for home automation I have a zwave/zigbee dongle, and a old server running a hypervisor and am comfortable with Linux. I was looking at domoticz or maybe calaos. but am open to suggestions not trying to do anything crazy just more than ifttt let's me. I have Samsung smartthings, wyze, hue, wemo and Alexa. I would also like to have the option to set up a control tablet at some point
Hi reddit, Cat\_Tacker here. Title says it all. I have been in love with Galaxy since I had my first S3, and now I am about to graduate from using an S8+ to the next best thing. What are some of your collective thoughts on the new devices? I've only glimpsed the new devices that are out right now, and I started to get tunnel vision on the verizon site and decided to turn to the only internet collective I trust: You. 

So, a little about my cellular usage behavior: I do NOT need anything larger than I am already using. I am perfectly content with the size; honestly this one is a little too big already because, let's be honest here, tiny hands. Aside from that, my primary usage is internet browsing, bill payment, google navigation, music streaming, and most importantly, photography (no, not selfies, either). I absolutely love how progressive the development of the in-phone camera has been over the past decade and am looking forward to what it will be like in the next. That being said, storage and memory are important. The Note10+ I saw has a 1tB memory, but I think I also read that they don't have a headphone jack? That's unappealing to me. 

So, redditors with newer galaxy devices, what are your thoughts and recommendations?
I'm upgrading from a [very old Samsung](http://www.hdtvsolutions.com/Samsung-LN32B540.htm) so I realize that just about anything will be an upgrade (though I still like it a lot). After reorganizing I found I may be able to accommodate a 55" and can maybe stretch my budget to a max of $500. I've looked through HT's buying guide and all the black Friday ads seem to be out (plus all the deals except door busters are already in place) so this seems like the best deal I'll get this month.

When it comes to detail, color, and brightness/contrast is the Vizio my best option or is there maybe something else I haven't seen yet?
So I was sitting in the tram going on my usual route home from work when a toddler and his mom get on. The kid is holding some Samsung tablet shit and her mom is clearly neglecting her. On the tablet was an episode of the power rangers fighting some demogorgon looking fuck when all of a sudden it explodes and the power rangers take off their helmets to clean off the demogorgon juice when I suddenly saw 1.337562 square centimeters of the pink power rangers chin and immediately I came and shot out 12 days worth of cum on the little girl sitting beside me and she was impregnated immediately. Needless to say the mom called the cops and I was arrested for impregnating a minor but that was the best orgasm of my life. No regrets

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I primarily plan on using it for general internet browsing, Netflix/Hulu, gaming, and editing pictures.

I'm by no means a professional, I just take pictures as a hobby and I would like to improve that hobby, but my current computer has prevented me from really getting into it and editing my pictures (my computer is 9.5 years old! definitely time for a new one, huh?). Lightroom and Photoshop would likely be used.

As for gaming, I'm clearly limited in what my current system can handle, so it's just a lot of older games like Half-Life 1 and 2, GTA III, GTA Vice City, League of Legends at the moment to name a few. I plan on continuing to play those games, but I want to play modern games as well.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

I'm sure any modern build can easily handle the older games mentioned above. I would like to be able to play modern games at higher settings and hopefully handle new releases for the next few years, at least.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Approximately $1,500. I can go above that a bit if someone thinks it's necessary and can explain why, but I would really like to stay closer to $1,500.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States. I plan on buying everything online.

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Regarding this build list: it is actually the result of putting together different build suggestions that were [previously made to me in the comments of another post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/dk89du/1500_budget_my_first_build/), so if someone wants to suggest a completely different build or point to one of the others in the comments from the link above, please don't hesitate to roast the build and explain why (remember: I'm new to this, so I probably have a lot to learn).

Other questions:

When the B450 motherboard is selected, I receive the following warnings: 

* "Warning! Some AMD B450 chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using Matisse CPUs. Upgrading the BIOS may require a different CPU that is supported by older BIOS revisions."
* "Note: The motherboard M.2 slot #1 shares bandwidth with SATA 6.0 Gb/s ports. When the M.2 slot is populated, two SATA 6.0 Gb/s ports are disabled."

Can someone explain in layman terms what these mean, and is it actually something to be concerned about? 

* **EDIT - MOTHERBOARD QUESTION/NOTE ABOUT THESE WARNINGS:** When I select an x570 motherboard, this seems to get rid of those warnings, so I guess I need to choose a different motherboard if I'm going with that CPU. Any recommendations?

* I assume the CPU comes with its own fan, so is it okay to use that fan or would you recommend buying a different one to use instead?

* How many case fans do you recommend? (either with the specific case listed or a different one of your own recommendation)

* Re: the graphics card, I was looking at the Radeon RX 5700 but noticed there is one with the name XFX RX-57XL8MFG6 and another as Sapphire PULSE. I don't fully understand the difference other than the look of it. Does this matter?

* What is the standard suggestion for RAM speed? DDR4-3200? 3600? Something else?

These are just a few of the questions off the top of my head, sorry if they seem silly, but I've been a bit out of the loop for a while now. This will be my first new computer since 2010. Please feel free to give additional information or suggestions that I didn't think to ask about, because like I said, I'm new to this and want it to go as smooth as possible.

So, I started picking out parts yesterday to build my first ever gaming PC, but while doing so, I couldn't figure out which video card to get for my build, so I've come to the always reliable site of Reddit for help. I've looked through many posts, and have seen recommendations for the GTX 2060 Super and the RX 570, but I'm not sure which to get. Help with picking a great video card would be greatly appreciated.

Here's my build so far:

I know that my build probably isn't that great (just picked parts with compatibility and good reviews), so any advice on improving it would be extremely helpful. Also, don't worry too much about price, I don't plan on getting everything at once. I'm fine with saving up if I have to.

Thanks in advance! üòä
I have a Samsung Galaxy A8 and a good chunk of the time the ball will not connect to my game. Any one else having this issue
I bought an used Odyssey from eBay that arrived yesterday. Setup went ok, but once it was on I noticed only the right eye screen was functional. Tried the usual troubleshooting, nothing worked. Then I tried again after a few hours: This time the left eye turns on for a few seconds, but the screen flickers a lot, then it just goes black again.

* Right eye works fine, only the left one is flickering/not working
* I've already tried plugging both cables in and out several times. And no, I'm not using an adapter
* Also updated NVidia drivers and uninstalled and reinstalled Mixed Reality Portal

Getting support or returning is not an option since I didn't buy from an official store, and I can't refund on eBay. And from what I've googled, this is unfortunately a common issue.

Now I'm looking for a tech repair shop that might be willing to open the headset to see if there's anything that can be fixed on the inside. If not, I'll probably sell for parts and look for another one. If you guys have any advice/solution, or would be interested in buying a broken Odyssey or 2 functional controllers, please let me know. For now, I'll stick to playing VR eyepatch-style

So lately I've been getting random ads come up when I'm using my phone, the icon for the app is supposed to be Samsung members. I then deleted the app and started getting ads from a game[same type, randomly popping up]. Is there an app that pretends to be others?
I have had Xfinity for quite some time and have almost always found the speed to be adequate.  Over the last week-10 days though, it has been really slow and laggy across an array of Windows, Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Android devices with both WiFi and wired Ethernet connections.  At times (like right now) I can't even get the Xfinity speed test, customer service live chat, or call back scheduling tools to load at all, though some internet works (like this Reddit post) albeit quite slowly.  X1 TV is fine, though the extra non-TV features like the sports app are super slow to load, if at all.

I was able to get through on chat a few days ago briefly, they did a modem reset and then I lost the chat connection, when the modem came back the same problems persisted.  I work a lot and haven't had the time or energy to try again.

I just want my old, not terrible internet back, please.  I also really don't want to sit on the phone forever, so I'm giving this sub a shot.


I have a samsung smart TV but the Disney+ app does not look available on my smart tv app homepage anyone know if the app for Samsung was to be made available at launch?
###Build Help:

I primarily use my PC for gaming and I am looking to upgrade some of the core components while keeping as much of my current PC as possible. I already have some of the parts in the list below, this is a draft of what the new, upgraded and completed version would look like.

The parts I already have are below ([link](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/WWzyVn) to my full current build for reference):

* Case
* Monitor
* Power supply
* Hard drive
* SSD (128 GB)

Below is a list of the parts I am looking to upgrade and why:

**CPU:** Seems like it's time to step up from the i5. Found a good deal on the 2700X for $130 including the cooler.

**GPU:** Probably the main driver behind push to upgrade, as my current R9 270 falls below the minimum for RDR2. **Hoping for feedback here especially, based on everything else.** I'll be keeping my eye out for good deals over the next month or so, not looking to spend more than $400 but I want it to be an upgrade that will last more than 3 years. 

**Motherboard:** Research indicates the X470 pairs well with the 2700x. I see that there is a compatibility issue with my current power supply but I've never messed around with overclocking before and probably won't in the near future. 

**RAM:** I currently have DDR3 and the X470 requires DDR4.

**Storage:** If I can find a good deal on 500gb or a TB SSD, I'll probably grab it. Saw the Samsung 1 TB on sale for $90, feedback welcome on that.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions or edits.
My S10+ has never had any trouble connecting to my car bluetooth or my galaxy buds. I recently got the samsung 3 frontier watch which always stays connected to the phone. But now, it only occasionally auto connects to my car or buds. Anyone know why or how to fix this issue? 

The phone is on the most current update and the everything is running on BT 5.0. There's no problem connecting to the devices if I do it manually. Sometimes my car will only connect for calls and not audio.
So i found this double sided USB-C cable for "data transfer" and was wondering if it wold work with my AP2 bc i have a sb-c port on my pc and also i want to use it with my samsung pro chromebook cuz the blutooth is glitchy. Thx
   I've been keeping an album of pictures for later reference, and been adding tags to them so I can look them up later. I have been doing this in my phone's default gallery app, made by Samsung (the app and the phone). How can I be sure that when I get a new phone that the tags will be maintained? Will Samsung's new-phone-transfer software transport the tags over as well as the images? If I want to back up the images on a cloud service, how do I maintain the tags?
Howdy and thanks for helping me out!

**What I have:**

I currently have 2 desktops, one for gaming and the other for VR/home theater stuff.  Now that I live in a 1 BR place - i'd like to just have one PC for everything.  I'd like to keep costs under $1500 but will have extra PC components I can/will sell to keep the budget 'flexible'.  

Here's a parts list I can draw from, otherwise if a better option exists i'll happily sell the existing parts for something better/new.

|PC 1|Corsair Air 540||
|:-|:-|:-|
|CPU|Intel Core i5-6500 @ 3.20 GHz||

|GPU| MSI GTX1070TI AERO 8G ||
|Monitor|HDMI into a receiver/projector||

Additionally I have a EVGA 1200W platinum PSU laying around.  

I have a 1TB m.2 drive for memory and a coolermaster CPU cooler

&amp;#x200B;

**What I want:**

High performance gaming with a small form factor.  (I'd prefer something similar or even smaller than my [Corsair Air 240](https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-CARBIDE-Micro-ATX-Mini-ITX-High-Airflow/dp/B00LA6WXEO/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=corsair+air+240&amp;qid=1573599852&amp;sr=8-3))
Budget isn't enough for any high end TV's and I have managed to narrow it down to the follow 3:

TCL 55DC748 - [Link to amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07GN7YQNJ/ref=twister_B07H5NKQH6?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1)

Samsung UE50RU7470 - 

Philips 50PUS6754/12 - [Link to comparison between this and the samsung](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/comparison/4dc5df468)

I am open to other TV suggestions around the ¬£500 price mark. Thanks alot in advance

I'm buying a Tab S6 at the end of the month and I'm going to use DeX as a laptop replacement. Now I'm a console gamer, but I play only a hand full of PC games on my laptop.

My question is, can I play them using DeX or is it still not possible?

*I'll add more as I think of it*
Not sure if this is the right forum

&amp;#x200B;

Can you please suggest if any of you are aware of a good deal for Thanksgiving on Samsung Galaxy S10 - US Version Unlocked - that can work on any carrier

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: I have a One year paid Mint plan ,SO looking for a phone upgrade to continue my Mint plan
Looking to up my storage again. I currently have a Samsung PM961 ( i believe) 500GB NVME SSD and I would like to upgrade to the 1tb version or similar.  

&amp;#x200B;

**My budget is about $150 for the SSD.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I also need an external HDD to store my photos on. Don't really need crazy space or speed on it so anywhere around 500GB should suffice and needs to be USB. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I don't have a set budget for the HDD as I don't know what they're going for.**

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you got! Thanks!


Hello,
I am planning to buy a used X260 (currently using X220) and want to give it a few upgrades. I am using Linux so if there are any issues you know of please tell me.

* **Screen** (IPS FHD): Should I buy a specific screen / are all screens compatible with all X260 variants? Where should I best buy the screen, eBay seems to sometimes deliver "[compatible parts](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/NEW-12-5-LED-FHD-1080-IPS-PANEL-DISPLAY-SCREEN-AG-FOR-IBM-LENOVO-THINKPAD-X260/312653574629?epid=518388798&amp;hash=item48cb9af1e5:g:kI4AAOSwaeVcdPo6)" or [have dead pixels](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Lenovo-Thinkpad-X260-FRU-00NY418-12-5-N125HCE-GN1-REV-C2-LCD-FHD-IPS-Screen/382130553353?epid=1105029117&amp;hash=item58f8c18209:g:MHYAAOSwMuZbt3ds)? (In particular I'm worried if the brightness controls will still work.)

* **RAM**: I am looking for 16 GB RAM, can you find this used or should I get new ones to make sure they are compatible (e.g. [Crucial](https://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en/compatible-upgrade-for/Lenovo/thinkpad-x260#MEMORYFilters))?

* **SSD**: Looking for 1 TB SSD, probably Samsung EVO 860. Is there a whitelist or is any SSD fine? Upgrading to M.2 for NVMe isn't worth it, is it?

~~* **Battery**: I will probably buy a cheap (non-genuine) battery - I got a Lenovo one for my X220 and it didn't last particularly long - unless there are major problems I should be aware of~~ Edit: Ok, I'll take a genuine one

* **Dock**: I'll get some used (genuine) docks and chargers from eBay for my different places, no surprises here I hope.

Is there anything I should look out for or anything that you would like to recommend? I'm very happy about advise and feedback!

Edit: Maybe I should say a bit about my use case. I am using the laptop for university, so most of the time it will be in its dock, probably with external monitor. Evenings at home (w/o monitor) and sometimes traveling. Giving presentations once in a while or taking it to conferences should be possible with little charging.

Edit2: Are both Wifi cards OK? Can the 2nd M.2 slot be used for something interesting (except LTE)?

Edit3: Total budget is ca. 500‚Ç¨
My Samsung Gear S3 recently updated and now it will not vibrate for anything. Many have the problem with notifications, but mine isn't vibrating for notifications, calls, alarms, etc. It doesnt even work in settings to test it. Please help!

I will price match if you believe you have found a similar phone currently listed at a better price. This would have to be from a fairly major site (eBay, swappa, nothing too obscure) and it must be an active listing.

Phones cannot be unlocked unless otherwise stated. All IMEI and serial number info is in the photos.

Will consider trades for higher end electronics, keep in mind I have to factor in the logistics of reselling the item at your convenience.

If you would like to sell your phone pm me ! Looking for iPhone models 8 and up and will consider newer models of other brands. I will offer more than competitor sites like gazelle and cover shipping.

Thanks!
I only ask because I can't install Samsung pay on a non Samsung phone, how would I say it up on the watch?

Hi Amd! Just recently built a Ryzen 7 2700x pc. I am coming from an old intel i5-2500k. I notice that my cpu temps are always bouncing around 45 to 50c the lowest I‚Äôve got is 42 and that is removing the panel of the case and the front panel. Is this thing normal for Ryzen 7 2700x. I notice on the videos I watch in YT like Jay2cents his cpu is around 35c at stock. Which is also my settings since I haven‚Äôt touch anything all is on default. I tried to use AIO cooler nzxt kraken 62 and Air cooler Noctua NH12 but both gave the same temps. I also tried 3 different cases and I still couldn‚Äôt make the temps lower than 40. Im just scared if this thing will last.

Here is my list
Ryzen 7 2700x
Asus CH7 Hero wifi
Noctua NH12 and NZXT kraken 62
GSkill ddr4 16gb 3200
Samsung 970 evo 500gb
Asus strix rtx 2070
Seasonic focus+ 650
3 cases was used
1. Corsair Carbied spec 06 (45 to 50c)
2. Phanteks P350x (44 to 50c)
3. Cooler Master H500 (43 to 50c)

These temps can reach at lowest 42 on idle if you remove the panels.

Is there a part of my pc which is bad and should be change?
Oops, meant C9 in tiitle. Basically budget is around 2k with the option to flex up a bit. I'm wondering whether the extra 10 inches are worth the decline in picture quality from the OLED to the QLED. The Samsung is 2k and the LG is 2.1k at the moment. Which is the better option? Anyone here have experience with those two models?

Should I look at Vizio Quantum as well? Sony?

Usage would be varied, with movies, tv, and some sports. Mostly streaming, but a small collection of 4k UHD BR as well. Probably only used 2-3 hours a day, so burn in isn't a concern.

Opinions?

Running T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S9 on 4G. No matter if it's the Ring app or the Rapid Ring. If I get a notification that someone is at my door and I click it then it's just a continuous black screen until it fails to connect. If I go back a couple minutes later then it shows that I answered. I can also review it. I'm also able to view a Live feed. Just seems clicking notifications Is broken for me..

RSSI -40
I followed all of the steps outlined on https://support.google.com/messages/answer/7189714?hl=en and still cannot send text messages with my Pixel 3a. I used to be able to send text messages over WiFi just fine with my previous phone, Samsung Galaxy S9. 

The only thing I am able to do is send and receive some Android users with RCS.
So I originally intended to get a budget AMD sffpc with like an rx580 and a ryzen 2600 which would've come out to around 800 Euro. However, I just found what seems to be the golden grail of deals on our local ebay equivalent (willhaben.at). Take a look at what this guy is offering:

All of that for 700 Euro.

I just put all the parts into pcpartpicker and it seems way too good to be true. Usually people sell their stuff above the MSRP. He already responded that I can pick it up tomorrow night!

Only downside is that I'll have to take a 5 hour train ride their, but I go for free and I can study for exams on the way.

What do you think about this deal? Did I overlook something? What should I look out for when I pick it up tomorrow.

Before christmas maybe during Cyber Monday or Black Friday. Maybe before that to play planet zoo

‚Äã

What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)

‚Äã

CPU, motherboard, gpu and CPU cooler as I like a quiet gaming machine

‚Äã

Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?

‚Äã

UK, England

‚Äã

If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.

‚Äã
500w evga b 80+ bronze psu

Ssds + 2tb hdd

Fractal design r4 case

‚Äã

Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?

‚Äã

No

‚Äã

Additional Info:

‚Äã
I'd like it as quiet as possible for the money. Nice CPU cooler + 0% spin gpu fans as well would be a plus. 


Below is my current build that I'm upgrading from

Just picked up the ASRock Z390 Taichi, and I decided to grab the Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe M.2 1TB because...why not?

I noticed that using either M.2 port 1 or 3 disables two SATA ports on the board (each).

But the M.2 port 2 only disables a single SATA IF you have a SATA M.2 drive.

Because my M.2 is an NVMe, I don't lose any of the eight SATA ports. Awesome.

BUT...

M.2 port 2 is right under the first PCIe slot, and that's where I put my fairly wide GTX 1070 Aero.

Running the M.2 without a heatsink, the temperature got up into the 50-60¬∞C range, which seems high.

I took the heatsink that was included with the motherboard on M.2 slot 3, and moved it over to M.2 slot 2.

BUT...

There's not enough space to screw it in, apparently. So I had to stick it on with the built-in tape (I'm guessing it's heat conductive), and then used some high-heat UL-rated FlexFix duct tape on the other end where the adhesive (and semiconductor on the SSD) isn't.

That lowers my temperature into the sub-50¬∞C range. Which is cool.

I have a lot of fans in this case, but it's currently open until I get everything zip-stripped inside.

I'm assuming that closing up both sides will force more air across the M.2 and perhaps lower the M.2's overall temperature.

I have four standard SATA Samsung EVOs in the front, with a large case fan blowing over them, and they run sub-25¬∞C.

Is there any way to reduce the heat? Is that caused by the large GPU literally right over the M.2? Will I lose anything moving the GTX 1070 from the first slot to the next slot over?

Sorry for the novel. It is NaNoWriMo month though....
A friend is about to get a Note 10+, which, as you may know, lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack. So he's going to have to go wireless, which he's not excited about and has been reluctant to use thus far.

It's difficult for me to ask specifics this close to the holidays without ruining the surprise, but I've gleaned some details from him over the past couple of months. Here's what I know:

* Sound quality is important to him, particularly bass, but I wouldn't consider him an audiophile
* Customizable EQ (and the ability to save those EQ settings to the earbuds) is very important
* Connection reliability is *extremely* important (I bought him a set of Crazybaby Air earbuds -- he hated their sound but primarily their connection issues)
* He uses his headphones primarily at the gym and occasionally around the house, so they need to be able to withstand some moisture
* USB C for charging is basically a requirement because it needs to be able to charge with the same type of cord as his phone
* Good battery life is crucial -- if he has to charge them more than once per week, I might as well just get him a box of C-to-3.5mm dongles
* Cost should be no more than $150, and under $100 would be even better (if the earbuds are expensive, he'll say "Why did you spend so much on earbuds?" and might make me return them, so they need to be reasonable in cost)

I know this is a pretty tall order. Oh, and I'd prefer for the cost to be less than $150.

I've been looking for options that meet all or most of these requirements, and here are some of the ones I'm considering:

* **Jaybird Vista** (drawback is that they're over my max price, but otherwise they seem to meet all criteria)
* **OnePlus Bullets Wireless 2** (I think he'd appreciate that the two buds are connected, which would make it easier to take out a bud and drape it around his neck if he wanted to talk to someone for a second, and it seems to also make for a more stable connection)
* **Jaybird Tarrah Pro** (upper limit of price point, but, again, I have an inkling he might like the two buds to be connected)
* **Bose SoundSport Wireless** (these are almost perfect... price is right, and he currently uses wired SoundSports that he really likes, so this seems like a no-brainer, but I'm not sure if it has a customizable/savable EQ and they charge with micro-USB instead of USB C, which is a major drawback)
* **Samsung Galaxy Buds v2** (these seem to be a good choice for a Galaxy user, and the price is good, seem to have good audio quality although sound output is generally low)
* **Sony WX-1000XM3** (if these were $150 or less, they'd probably be the winners)
* **Aukey T10 True Wireless Earbuds** (price is right, have most other features I need, but no EQ)
* **Jabra Elite 75t** (have everything I need, but a bit too pricy)
* **Apple AirPods v2** (this option is at the bottom of the list and more about ease of use than anything else... they lack the customizable EQ and are Lightning instead of USB C)

If anybody has any feedback on these or other models to suggest that might meet my criteria, please let me know!
I have the HW-K430 samsung sound bar. I want to use the tv remote to change the volume on the soundbar. My tv is also a samsung. Does anyone know how I could connect them? At the moment im using an optical cable.
First of all I want to clarify that pc parts in Pakistan are super overpriced. I've updated the prices on this list to match the price I'm able to get them. I was on a budget of 1k but I couldn't make a decent machine for 144hz and It bloated to 2k. This is my first pc build. The last pc I had was a PENTIUM III. I'm not super rich. I've spent countless paychecks to finally save up for this baby. I would appreciate it if you could tell me how to save more money and improve performance. Thank you in advance. 


Every part is new. I spent 3 days in the local stores but couldn't find good used parts.

Disney+ is available on 2016 onwards TV models but not Apple TV app! Why? It cannot be a decision on Apple, can it? It cannot be software limitations either, right?
So if I'm watching Netflix though my Xbox One X which supports DV but my new Samsung Q90 does not support DV.... Am I missing out on an amazing visual difference?  I have an LG right now that supports just about everything and visuals are fantastic. If I move to Samsung am I going to stream a Netflix show and be sad that the image is noticeably worse?
I have had this issue for a while now with my Samsung S9. When I leave my home I need to remember to toggle airplane mode to not miss any messages, since it doesn't always automatically get an IP-address. 

I have seen this issue occurring for S8, S9 and S10. This is a pain in the *ss when you have spent this much money on a phone that can't receive messages reliably.

Anyone know what the issue might be? I have contacted my carrier but they have not been able to help at all.
I'm reasonably certain this is possible, but I can't find a simple guide online. I'm trying to help my dad set this up on his watch (I don't have a samsung) through text.

I did a test on  [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/21682223](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/21682223) and it says my pc is performing way below expectations. i would like to improve that. my specs are:

&amp;#x200B;

* CPU: Intel Core i7-6700K - 
* GPU: Nvidia GTX 1060-6GB - 
* SSD: Samsung 850 Evo 250GB -

Coding and gaming. I use linux for coding and other work.                       
                                                                                
I'll be avoiding Nvidia as the AMD gfx drivers are open source which leads to less headaches. Probably make various upgrades later once parts becomes cheaper.
                                             
**Gaming performance requirements**                                             
1440p. 60+ fps. High/ultra graphics settings. I've already got two 30"/2560x1600/60hz monitors that refuse to die after about a decade. Eventually they will and I'll probably get two smaller 1440p/120hz monitors. Will only be single screen gaming.

Hi all! I‚Äôve had a Samsung oddessy for about half a year now and i was wondering if there was any wireless adapter that I don‚Äôt know of. If not, does the vive adapter or tpcast work at all with the headset?

thanks,

Hey all. I haven't built a PC since ivybridge days and am still curently running a i5 3570K with an R9 290 which I plan to get rid of... got some components which are still usable including a Samsung 1TB SSD, Corsair RM850 and a H100i, hence no SSD/PSU or cooling in the build... everything looking good? Mainly just want to game at 144hz 1440p and have a couple of peripheral screens for multitasking.

ILL BE PUTTING ALL SPECS AT THE END OF THE POST TO KEEP IT ORGANIZED


hello thanks for reading 
so i‚Äôve been having in game stutter issues pretty frequently and it has seemed to have gotten worse and worse, so me thinking it was a faulting part decided to make some upgrades(new cpu, mobo, and ram) low and behold still the same issues. 

I‚Äôm thinking at this point maybe it‚Äôs my power supply just not having enough power behind it so i decide to upgrade that as well. no bueno mi amigo. So at this point (i think i‚Äôve already reinstalled windows as well) i start just going mad trying to find software solutions driver deletion tweaks in the bios multiple driver versions, bios versions, different overclocks, reinstalling windows an uncountable amount of ones with different versions. 

somewhere during this two week period i picked up on latency mon and start monitoring everything. I realized i get high execution times even on fresh windows install and my isr count on Wdf01000.sys is really directly correlated with my usb activity (mouse movement keyboard strokes sound) kind of had some higher latency spikes of 300 with fresh installs and these momentary freezes. it seemed to be pointing to this kernel and when i would download my display driver (nvidia and later in this post amd) the latency would only get worse. I should mention at this point as well that all my benchmarks were completely where they should be. I tested with heavens, furmark, aida 64, cpu z and monitored with after burner and hwmonitor and taskmanager. 

so i‚Äôm thinking maybe it‚Äôs my mouse causing it because its only happens when i move my mouse around well i try two other mice and it still happened. So i finally decide that it has to be my gpu and replace it as well same issue. So besides my new $1000 trash can after two weeks of endlessly testing this hunk of actual disappointment I am completely at a loss. I should mention i used two different ssd‚Äôs for these installs throughout the process as well. well two days ago i finally decided to call msi and they tell me the mother board is faulty, well it wasn‚Äôt. i had it exchanged for a new one at the retailer and same thing. So i call amd today and they tell me that it sounds very much like a faulty processor even though i tell them about the old system doing the same thing they said it was odd but the most logical thing. I replace the cpu AND BODDA BUNG BODDA BOOM i‚Äôm still out $1000 :D so i call them back and they tell me they have no idea what it could be, i mention the electricity and they say it‚Äôs very unlikely because my power supply should be maintaining clean voltages on its own. so i‚Äôm not really sure what to think also when i replaced the mother board i continued all my testing on top of the motherboards carboard box instead of my case. so i‚Äôm here typing this out and just clueless as what it could be besides a driver conflict???(lol) or dirty power/bad grounding. i need some advice here i think testing a power conditioner would be worth a shot but spending half of what my pc cost just to be able to play on a double conversion UPS would be a bit much so really i‚Äôm just taking any suggestions at this point. I know i didn‚Äôt give much info on what software tweaks and drivers i‚Äôve tried...it‚Äôs because there have just been so many i wouldn‚Äôt even be able to begin listing all of them. Even a fair few registery edits. 

So if you can help me i will gladly take any suggestion and try it to my fullest ability. i‚Äôm looking for some good candidates to try for the power conditioner as well if you think it would be worth a shot, i‚Äôm trying to stay under $100 if at all possible. 


First pc specs -

Cpu - I7 4790k @ 4.5 ghz OC‚Äôd and tried no overclock.

GPU - Gigabyte 1080 oc wind force.  tried my old 750 ti on this set up as well

RAM - hyper x fury 16gb @ 1666 Mhz

Adata 120gb SSD

EVGA 500w 80 plus PSU

MOBO - Asrock h97 pro



Second/third pc specs-

CPU - Ryzen 5 3600 overclockes to 4GHZ and tried no overclock

GPU - same 1080 then the 750ti then eventually bought the rx 5700 xt 

RAM - 16gb of LPX corsair vengeance at multiple frequencies the best seeming to be at stock. timings and freq.

PSU - corsair cx650m

zheino 500gb ssd 

MOBO - b450 tomahawk 

same case throughout builds thermal take soemthing or another, tested on a 60hz samsung monitor as well as the vg248qe @ 144 and set frame cap limiters and such things to try and smooth out the gameplay. I tried changing to display port as well instead of the dual channel dvi that came with it. I‚Äôve tried other outlets in my home to the same issue, i know i should probably test them i‚Äôm working on doing that next. Also am gonna put all my parts back in the case and try it at a friends house.


SORRY THE FORMATTING IS TERRIBLE


edit: i just remembered a little side note and i‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôre related, but i stream and use ndi to transfer video to my stream pc.  i would notice the stutters would increase and i could only think that could be network related to packet loss right but the issue happens when i‚Äôm on my desktop just browsing my pc and what not not just in game.

Hi!

I'm a newly minted executive assistant thrown an IT project that the company I work for has pitched at multiple IT firms.  My job is now to do it cheaper. 

The task?
I need to figure out a solution to replace a fax machine at a location that only has access to a wifi point they do not control. I am told to make this system as foolproof as possible as the users of this service are not tech savvy. I have a budget of $600.

-They don't want scanners. They get dirty and produce poor prints.

-They don't want wireless (of any sort). What if it disconnects from the printer???????

-It has to be a device with a back facing camera so that they can photograph scan documents. This is okayish.

-Inkjet printers are out, maintenance is too expensive.

-They want a wired base solution.
 
-Windows is insecure and too complex. They want android.

My ideal solution would have been a wireless fax machine. With that out? A cheap laptop/tablet and printer/scanner with direct connect. No? How about a basic Surface??? You can take pictures, send, receive email, and it has a USB port for printers. Also no.

So now here I am, with a Samsung Galaxy Tab A, an OTG cable, and an HLL-2320D Brother printer. It is not working.

The printer seems to wake up on command from whatever various app I install, but never actually prints.

I'm willing to work with any ideas here. Would you guys be able to help? It can be a new solution or just troubleshooting, but I'm hoping for a fresh perspective. I'd much appreciate it.
TL;DR: Pc started having fps issues in several games (15-30fps down from 140fps). Tried to debug. Ended up resetting to factory windows uninstalling everything. Bought new graphics card. Same problem plus more problems now.

Parts:

* CPU - Ryzen 1950x threadripper
* Graphics - Nvidia gtx 1080ti (old, replaced yesterday) msi nvidia 2080super (current)
* RAM - Corsair 4 x 16gb 3200mhz (at work not sure exact kind right now)
* Motherboard - MSI x399 carbon gaming pro
* Cooler - Enermax liqtech liquid cooler (also not sure exacts) + some front and back fans came with case
* Storage - Samsung SSD 960 EVO Series - 1TB PCIe NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD
* PSU - Corsair HX1000i (1000w) -&gt; (using a surge protector as well) note: I've never seen my psu fan spinning, I've always figured it was running when I wasn't looking for it. Maybe it's broken...
* OS - Windows10

I built a custom pc a 1.5 years ago.  It worked fine all this time except for one issue that I was seeing in fortnite. It seemed that alt tabbing was causing my fps to drop from 140+ down to 20-30. If I alt tabbed I would have to restart my pc entirely to fix the issue. Other games ran fine and could be alt tabbed. I ignored this issue. A few weeks ago I reinstalled fortnite and was seeing the same issue. Tested out the problem in battlefield 5 and was getting 10fps without alt tabbing. I had been planning to upgrade my 1080ti to a 2080super so I figured I'd go get one. Picked it up and swapped them out. Started up fortnite and was getting a solid 240fps. Alt tabbed. Same problem. Restarted my pc and loaded fortnite again. DIDN'T alt tab this time, but restart didn't fix the issue and was getting 20fps. Note that before swapping the graphics cards I had noticed my pc had been running slower for a few weeks and was taking longer to load games, file viewer, etc. Pretty much everything. Now after replacing the graphics card my system seemed to be running even slower. Searched online forums. Can't seem to figure it out.

Some of my attempts at debugging:

* Clean install of nvidia graphics drivers - didn't fix
* Uninstall geforce experience overlay - didn't fix
* Check temps for cpu and gpu: cpu = 62c gpu = 50c (after playing fortnite for 30min and then alt tabbing which probably stopped using graphics card cooling it down?) 
* Factory reset entire system, deleted all files, brand spankin' new os install - didn't fix
* Reseated ram sticks
* Ran windows memory test last night, around 12% the test said it ran into hardware issues and to contact the computer manufacturer... which is me I guess? I stopped the test and figured I try again in the morning
* Ran memtest86 this morning ---&gt; this is where I found issues

While running memtest86 I was able to get through the first 4 tests, then during test 5 (or 6?) my computer shutdown. Hmm, okay that's weird. Booted up to memtest86 again and started a new test. Same thing. Computer shutdown during test 6. I figured lets start the pc, login to windows, and try some other tests, but when I was brought to the windows login screen my pc shutdown again. No test running this time. Ran out of time and had to head to work. This is where I am currently at.

Current possibilities I've been thinking of:

* Online forums for memtest86 shutdown point towards a motherboard issue not ram issue... not sure if this is correct
* Planning on removing all my ram and running memtest86 against each ram stick individually
* It could possibly be my powersupply dying because maybe the fan inside has never worked
* Maybe my new graphics card isn't compatible with my motherboard or motherboard needs a driver update
* Possible malware. Would factory reset fix this or no? I stream stuff from some shady links sometimes :(
* Pc is pretty dusty inside, gonna buy a gas duster today, if this fixes it then hallelujah.

Steps I'm planning on doing tonight:

* gas duster everything
* test each ram stick individually
* buy a new psu and see if that fixes it
* if none of those work maybe it's my motherboard

What other steps should I follow to debug all my hardware or software if suspect?
I am buying my first 4k tv (TCL R617) and am very interested in the N950 because of the Atmos.

Has anyone heard this soundbar in person before? Does the sound really envelope you? Would you recommend if? I'll be using it mainly for streaming movies from Netflix and Amazon.

It's on sale in Canada for $1500.

https://m.visions.ca/#/home-productdetail?productId=45095&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAzanuBRAZEiwA5yf4ugPGTjcF_846qIznstKsCBNeK2yqPDu_vIIl3zw9UIu8nS2GqA-47xoCVYYQAvD_BwE
Because I'm surely not.

I have a problem with my S8 for the past four days. It won't turn on if if it isn't in charge and turns itself off when it is in charge. When I'm using it the phone will sometimes work very slowly and I've had 'system UI isn't responding' come up on the screen multiple times.

At this point it sometimes doesn't get past the SAMSUNG screen when turning it on and I'm not sure if I can repair my phone or if I need a new one. Any advice would be incredibly helpful, thank you :)
T-Mobile currently has a 50% off deal for Samsung phones to military vets right now. I currently have the Google pixel 3a and while I love it, the lack of external storage is forcing my hand to move on. I am primarily looking at the s10e because it seems like it hits all the checks without breaking the bank. I don't like huge phones and don't care for the note lineup. So I guess it's really between the s10e or the S10 but I'm leaning towards the s10e. Does anybody have any input on this?
Hello, I've been toying with flow today and I noticed that I can't change the input language. It defaults at my local language (greek).

Touch keyboard doesn't show because it's connected in smart view and changing language from windows doesn't affect sam flow. Is there anything i can do?

My phone is Note 9 Exynos if it matters.

Thanks :)

I have zeroed in on the Samsung Q series to purchase this Thanksgiving. These are the options and i‚Äôm unable to decide which is the better- 

1. QN75Q70RAFXZA - $2000

2. QN65Q70RAFXZA - $1200

3. QN75Q60RAFXZA - $1500

(Amazon Prices)

Ideally I would prefer 75‚Äù and Q70 over Q60 but $2000 is too expensive for me. That leaves 2 options for me. 

Should I pick a bigger TV(Q60 with 75‚Äù) or higher series(Q70 with 65‚Äù)?
I currently have a 7-year-old build with an AMD FX-8350 (8-Core 4.0 GHz). I started getting into x264 video encoding early this year and the stock fan was not handling the heat well when encoding for hours on end, especially when overclocking. Knowing I'd be building a new computer late this year, I ponied up for a Noctua NH-D15 fan. It dropped my temps &gt;15 degrees and I'm able to hit 4.4-4.5 GHz regularly during sustained encoding sessions. I plan to move the Noctua over to the new build and it came with the AM4 kit.

Video encoding is the reason I'm spending as much as I am on the CPU. I'm considering bumping up to the 3800X but is it worth $60 just to increase stock from 3.6 to 3.8 and overclock from 4.4 to 4.5... 

Any other thoughts on my picks?

Hi,

I'm a first year engineering student and I was just tasked with designing and 3D printing something small that I would use in my daily life. I decided to design a phone case for my Samsung Galaxy A8 (2018). The specifications on the Samsung website only give the length, width, and height of the phone and not the specifications of features such as the volume/power buttons, headphone jack, camera, etc. I was wondering if anyone here has access to the exact dimensions of these features?

This is for gaming at 1920x1080p FPS, And even editing photos
I apologize if this question has been asked before, I‚Äôm new to the sub.

I recently purchased a 65‚Äù X950G as an upgrade for my old W800B 50‚Äù tv for a great price (Best Buy Black Friday pricing). Overall I‚Äôm very happy with the set but I purchased primarily for the upgrade to the PS5. I‚Äôve done some research and am starting to think maybe I should wait for 2020 to get a set with HDMI 2.1 for eventual 4K 120 content and VRR. I‚Äôve read that VRR and QMS can be added via firmware updates but was somewhat concerned about the 120hz and whether Sony would add these at all. (Doubtful the console will have much for native 120 &amp; Sony‚Äôs motion handling is great for movies) 

A couple of things I‚Äôve noticed: 
1. eARC is already available on the set (from what I understand the spec doesn‚Äôt need HDMI 2.1 bandwidth it‚Äôs just part of the standard)
2. Low latency mode seems like it‚Äôs partially implemented via Sony‚Äôs auto picture mode which changes into game mode when I switch to a game on my ps4 and back to standard mode if I launch the ps4 Netflix app. - not a game changer but a convenient feature nonetheless. 

I‚Äôve also read up on the X1 ultimate chip and it sounds like it‚Äôs the same hardware Sony is using in its 8k sets and has been in development for a couple of years. 

My question is this: Is it likely Sony used flexible HDMI architecture in the X950G for an eventual firmware upgrade to HDMI 2.1 considering the chip can handle the extra bandwidth? I have a few days left to return the TV and am nervous that lack of VRR and things like 1440p @ 120hz that some Samsung‚Äôs currently have will have me feeling a little remiss I didn‚Äôt wait for a set with HDMI 2.1 - I‚Äôd like to stay with Sony and this set is fantastic in every other way.

I want to upgrade my dads old pc a bit. So im thinking to get him from 4gb RAM to 8gb. Currently he has two RAM sticks (each 2GB). Would [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crucial-CT51264BD160BJ-PC3L-12800-Single-240-Pin/dp/B005NU49DG/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=crucial%2Bddr3%2B4gb&amp;qid=1573587942&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1) RAM work with it? I also want to get him [Samsung 860 EVO SSD](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-MZ-76E1T0B-EU-Solid-State/dp/B078WQJXNF/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ssd&amp;qid=1573588486&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1). Would these be compatible with this MB? Or is there something better to get?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the specs:

Motherboard - MSI H55M-E23 (MS-7636)

RAM - 4GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 664MHz

CPU - Intel Core i3 560 @ 3.33GHz
I've got quite a lot of movies on my computer's hard drive. How can I access these movies on my Android devices? I have a Samsung Galaxy phone and a Samsung Galaxy tablet. Oh yeah I also have a Samsung TV but that's beside the point 8)

Anyway thanks for any help!
Hey everyone! I've started my 1st "ssf" HTPC and I need  some help with a choice of motherboard. Is there any good B-450 Mini ITX boards out there that supports Ryzen 3000 out of the box? I'd like to get a 3600 but I don't have any other CPU's to update my BIOS and I'd just like it to all work. 
If anyone is interested here are my specs

-Silverstone Milo ML-07
-Ryzen 5 3600
-GSKILL Trident Z 3200
-Silverstone SFX 600
-Samsung 970 Evo 1TB

Hi,

I am interested in knowing if anyone has analysed the data sharing policies of various fitness trackers (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin, Samsung and the likes) in the market. With Google having bought off Fitbit, I am interested in moving away from it. And this time around I want to make a more aware choice of which companies use my fitness data in what manner.

Cheers!
So i have a passed down vizio sb2920-c6 soundbar and i like It however the sound is very muffled and the vocals get lost in the action and it lacks a punch. It has DTS and the immersion is incredible so thats a plus.

I was also looking at a samsung r450 which comes with a subwoofer and its $160

I cant find any stores that have these for display, so i was wondering if i could get any advice on keeping the bar i have or spending $160 on the samsung. Perhaps some of you already own the samsung.

Im not too crazy about movies and watch them occasionally, some gaming here and there too but it would be nice if it sounded good.


My specs:
macOS Catalina version 10.15
Macbook Pro 13-inch mid 2012
Processor: 2.9 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7
Memory: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB

Recently installed a 512 GB Samsung Solid State SATA drive, replaced the optical drive with a data doubler and put in my old 1 TB WD hard drive. Ever since I put these two hard drives in my macbook it's been acting kind of... weird. The fan has been going crazy despite no applications running and the macbook would randomly shut down whenever the charger was unplugged. Now, it just won't charge at all.

My charger is relatively new (bought it a few months ago), tried doing an SMC reset, tried different outlets, removed and put back the battery. Nothing. Any suggestions?

So I am curious to what people think about [this] (https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Double-49-Inch-Monitor-LC49RG90SSNXZA/dp/B07L9HCJ2V/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=49%22+ultrawide+1440p&amp;qid=1573587486&amp;sr=8-6) monitor for use as my main gaming monitor. I was thinking of getting rid of my current set up of 3 monitors, I currently use a 2560x1440p 144hz for gaming then 2 others for twitch chat and OBS. I was thinking of the 49" ultrawide and spliting the screen up so my main game would be in the middle and the two sides would be for OBS and twitch chat. Would the image still be 1440p? Would it be worth it? How is this monitor?
After upgrading to TinyCam Pro 13.1.4 I am now getting a "Failed Loading P2P native code" when trying to view WyzeCams with the Cloud Protocol. 

WyzeCams with the RTSP protocol support are still working.

I got a Surface laptop 3 (13, i7/16g) that replaced my macbook pro and I love the device (it has everything I loved about the mac without OSX and better specs for less money). There is just one thing that I cant figure out wether it is me that makes a mistake of Microsoft that fucked up.. I got a monitor with USB-C connectivity and power delivery, and it was always charging my macbook when connected, and it will also charge a cheap dell that I use as a backup computere.. but it wont charge the SL3.

The monitor: Samsung SH850 (24").

Other issue I got is that when i daisy chain the monitor to my 2nd external monitor using the displayport out, both screens start showing artifacts (mostly with moving content like video). It is like small green streaks/dots. And sometimes the 2nd external monitor just turns black for a couple of seconds.

Has anyone experienced power delivery issues when also using the usb-c for video? And does anyone know what I could do to fix this? I would really enjoy the aesthetics of having just one cable to my laptop for everything
I'm putting together a second build just for gaming and was wondering if this is a good setup? I have a 1080 144hz monitor right now but will eventually switch over to 1440. Just want a system that will run games smoothly at high FPS on 1440. My old pc had a Ryzen 5 2700 and 1060 which I'll be giving to my younger brother. Any suggestions that I should make? I have a $2000-$2500 budget.

For reference, I have a i7-7700k, EVGA 1070 SC Black, and mobo is asus prime z270-A.
Monitor is Samsung CFG73 27" 144Hz
I have updated bios and all other drivers.

When I boot my PC, I do not see the ASUS screen or windows. I can spam delete and I can tell that BIOS is open but my monitor will not open. If I have my PC hooked up to a HDMI connection, however, I am able to see the ASUS screen, BIOS and windows booting screen. 

I am unsure what the issue is but my guess is that it is a GPU issue.
Hey everyone, our washer (not at work not sure of brand. For sure not Samsung or LG and probably 5 or so years old) recently shared

1. Snagging out clothes and causing little rips

2. Even after being balanced bounces violently all over the place even with tiny loads

3. We're noticing little black spots on our clothes, they look little grease stains. 

I have a guy coming out this week or next but I wanted everyone's opinion on what it could be
###Troubleshooting Help:

**What is your parts list?**

Specs:
CPU: Ryzen 7 2700x
CPU Cooler: Stock Ryzen RBG Fan that came with the CPU (kept it for the RBG)
MOBO: Asus B450F Gaming Motherboard
Memory: 4 sticks Corsair Vengeance Pro DDR4-3000 
HDD: Seagate 4TB 3.5" 5900RPM
SSD: 1TB Samsung EVO M.2
Graphics Card: MSI GeForce GTX 1070 8GB
PSU: Corsair CXM 550W 80+ Bronze
Case Cooling: Stock fans that came with my NZXT h500 (2 120mm I believe)

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

When loading into Apex Legends lobby, my computer struggles to load in my player data. If it fails to load in, my computer hard crashes and restarts, the event viewer gives me a kernel power error. Task Manager says Apex Legend‚Äôs power usage is very high. The hard crashing does not occur with other games like Destiny 2 or Titanfall 2 (only other games I‚Äôve launched). 

**List anything you've done in an attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

I have updated my graphics driver, I have put Apex on the SSD, I have cleaned my fans (haven‚Äôt cleaned my graphics card), turned off fast boot, turned off HDD shutdown in power saver settings (basically everything suggested on forums to fix kernel errors), and I have repaired the game 5 or so times and reinstalled it at least 2 or 3 times through the Origin launcher. 

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

My current theory, as all my other theories haven‚Äôt solved the problem yet, is that my PSU can‚Äôt handle the up kick in power demand that Apex requires, *the PSU is now probably 3 and a half years old*. My main question besides any other feedback you all could provide is if my theory is likely the main cause of my problems.

Edited to add more info about PSU

Hi!

So today I've Hackintoshed my system (specs are at the bottom). I have Windows 10 running on one SSD and High Sierra on the other SSD and everything works great. The reason I went with High Sierra was because of my GPU. But I figured Mojave would work too using my iGPU. My question now is: How would I go about installing Mojave and essentially have a triple-booting setup? Because I would have to install it on an SSD that already has OS on it (I guess the one with High Sierra). Thanks in advance!

Specs:

Intel Core i5 4690  
GTX 1060 6GB  
ASUS H97M-E motherboard  
Samsung 850 EVO 250GB + Crucial BX500 240GB  
1TB Seagate Barracuda + 500GB WD Blue  
12GB DDR3 RAM
I have a Samsung Galaxy S10 and about a week ago I was deleting apps, I think I may have deleted something that Android Auto used for it. I can't find what app it would be though

I haven‚Äôt stayed remotely aware of the world of PCs in the past ten years so I‚Äôm quite out of it, but I‚Äôm finally looking to get back into PC gaming and build my own rig. I will be using this machine solely for gaming and my goal is to do 2K gaming at 144hz. I‚Äôve talked myself down from a 9900K to a 9600K and from a 2080 Super to 2070 Super, but I‚Äôm still pretty malleable on the details. Am I doing anything super stupid with build or would you make any huge changes? 

I likely will be hanging onto this build relatively as is for 5 or so years before making any sweeping changes, so I‚Äôm looking to ‚Äúfuture proof‚Äù a bit if possible but it seems like this world changes fast. I don‚Äôt have a monitor selected yet, but will likely go for a 4K monitor, but game at 1440p.

Has Samsung also removed the ability to pin apps in the Android share menu?

Hi all!

I recently built a new PC for myself and I've been getting random BSOD's. A few days ago the BSOD's started coming very frequently, taking less than 15 minutes to crash. Weird thing is, that the system was relatively stable a few months with only a couple BSOD's here and there. The constant BSOD's started after I updated to latest BIOS, and not even rolling back helps now.

I think I've tried nearly every solution, and I'm starting to think it's a hardware issue. But I need to be able to recognize which component it is.

My components are:

* CPU - AMD Ryzen 7 3700x
* MB - MSI X570-A PRO
* GPU -  ROG Strix GeForce GTX 1070 OC
* SSD - 1TB Samsung 970 EVO Plus M.2 NVMe
* RAM -  G.Skill RipjawsV DDR4 3200 MHz 16 Gb 
* PSU -  Corsair RM650X

What I've tried so far:

* Tested with different SSD, RAM and PSU.
* Re-installed Windows 10 Pro
* Latest drivers for all components
* Lowering CPU/RAM voltages
* Disabling Core Performance Boost &amp; Precision Boost Overdrive
* Running with only one RAM stick
* Checked CPU pins and motherboard for broken capacitors
* Re-seated everything

My main suspects would be the MB, CPU and GPU, since I've been able to test all other components with different ones.

I don't know if it's any use posting minidumps of the BSOD's, since they are totally random errors and some won't even be written because the system crashes instantly.

Are there any tips on how to go forward from here? It would be great if I could pinpoint the failing component so I can replace it.
Hi, I am looking for budget monitor which I am stuck with these two. To my game preferences ms is not important, so I am going for IPS. Which one should I get? Another suggestion would be great also around these prices(150$). I am out of America therefore I have to think currency If you think price is too low for a better monitor.
Thoughts?

I received my soundbar back from a Samsung repair depot that was badly damaged either at the repair depot or in transit. I'm trying to follow up on the issue to see what the next steps are. All I've been told is that it's with the UPS coordinator and they will be in touch. Has anyone here ever had to deal with Samsung's UPS coordination department and if so, how was your experience?

&amp;#x200B;

On my Samsung Tab A 10.1 2019 i like to use outdoor mode for increased brightness but it only stays on for 15 minutes. 

Is there anyway to keep it on at all times ?

Thanks.
I have a new smart tv 75‚Äù q6 Samsung qled and sometimes when I turn on the tv it goes str8 to tv and the sync box and works fine and when I turn off the tv the lights light up and are controllable through app of course but like today I had ten mins before my tv would go to the cable (only device I have connected to sync box bc of the Smart hdmi recognizes it as a cable box by frontier still) so my beef is like today it took ten mins to get the tv to display an image and sound and this is a Samsung thing but today it wouldn‚Äôt turn on and show picture bc the app on its own decided to turn off the sync box so I turned it back on in the app and tv is working and when I turn my tv off the hue lights brighten up and make it match the kitchen and rest of the lights so long story short how to stop app from turning off sync box so the picture gets to the tv 

Has nothing to do with the lights but the sync box and entertainment area lights
So, I'm looking for a new monitor for coding, some gaming (not competitive!) and occasional b&amp;w photo retouching. The display needs to have a VESA mount to be mounted on the wall and should be 1440p. Since my PC sits roughly 7-7.5m away from the desk underneath the TV (and won't be moved) I'll have to use a 7.5m DP cable and potentially spend some money on it (\~50‚Ç¨). I'm looking for a monitor up to 300ish ‚Ç¨. My head will be about 80-85cm away from the wall and the display will be wall mounted.

My current rig is all 1080p and 60Hz but my 1080Ti should be capable of running 4k in most situations.

I found 3 interesting displays and a 4th one that's a bit over budget but I can't find many information on them.

Philips E-Line 328E9FJAB 31.5" 16:9 1440p 75Hz VA curved - 265‚Ç¨  
Samsung U32J590 31.5" 16:9 4k 60Hz VA flat - 268‚Ç¨  
Samsung S34J550 34" 21:9 1440p 75Hz VA flat - 329‚Ç¨  
LC-Power LC-M34-UWQHD-100-C 21:9 1440p 100Hz VA curved - 365‚Ç¨

Do you guys have any recommendations and/or experiences with one or more of those models?

 

&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* Gaming (MOBA FPS: OW (1080p Med 144 FPS)), CS, R6 (1080p Med/High 144FPS)) (Triple A (MW: 2K 60 FPS Ultra/High)

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* **I would like an ITX/mATX build. Preferably mostly black. I'm somewhat open to RBG fan lighting (Changed my mind since last post)**
* Maybe some White accenting? Really whatever looks nice with a RTX 2080 TI FE (Silver)
* I am coming from a Fractal Node case. I definitely want something bigger but still not huge. It has to be able to accommodate a hybrid CPU cooler.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* No. I can slap my M2 w/ Win 10 into the new machine.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

* Nothing ATM.

Guys I need an opinion about this pc setup!!

CPU Cooler - Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO

Motherboard - GIGABYTE AORUS Z390 PRO

SSD - Samsung 970 EVO Series 1TB PCI Express x4 M.2 2280

Works just fine, tried a few different movies/shows.  Can't run it through my PS4 though at all - I use Strong, IP Vanish (through my router to the PS4), and Strong DNS spoofer depending on what steaming app I want to use.
I'm an avid tech fan! And that's the main reason why I find joy in using flagship devices. I enjoy snappy response and good looks as well. That's the reason why in early 2014, I got myself an HTC One M7, which to this day still looks awesome, they have great speakers! However, I now need to get a new phone. And I need to get a good one. I LOVED my 2013 flagship Htc device, and after quite some research considering my budget and features of phones, I now have two phones that I've got to choose from. One is the OnePlus 7 Pro, which is a 2019 flagship and the other is Samsung Galaxy Note 9, a 2018 flagship device. They both have their own features that makes them worth it, but I really want to make the good choice with this phone I'm going to buy, because I believe I'll be using it for the next 6 years or so.   


Questions: 1) Is the 90Hz display really that amazing? I haven't got the chance to see it in person  
2) Despite the Samsung being a 2018 flagship, does that mean it might last less longer than the other phone in terms of support software wise?  
3) I like the idea of the S pen, but is it really used a lot?  


4) OnePlus 8 is rumored to be coming up soon. Should i just wait till that comes out? (I don't want to miss out on new tech, but for me personally if i'll pick the samsung, i won't have that issue at all)  


And oh, i don't mind not having wireless charging. That's not an issue for me. I also don't like notches, and both doesn't have one.  ( I prefer some bezels than a notch)  


Thanks for the help in advance guys!
###Build Help/Ready:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

This build is for my wife's business.  It will mostly be used for basic stuff, Word, Excel, Chrome, Discord, Google Docs, Some CRM software I forget the name of, Conference Calls (Skype, Zoom), and maybe the most intensive task will be some basic video editing, possibly in Premier, but TBD; it's way down the list anyway.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

Probably nothing unless the kids talk her into playing Minecraft.  Doesn't need to be a consideration.  Already have a monitor, 1920x1200.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Really just trying to go as cheap as possible.  Currently under $400, and I'd like to stick to that.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA.

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please).**.

Already have Windows 10, Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse.  Also have the SSD that I have listed, but included it for compatibility with other components.

Goal is an ITX build to take up minimal desk space, and the case and mobo are basically the cheapest options (but still great).

8GB would probably do her, but memory is so cheap right now, and I want a bit of future proofing.  16GB will also help if she does some video editing.

My main question is on the CPU, as I'm not familiar with AMD or onboard graphics.  Is this adequate?  Could I go cheaper, such as a AMD Ryzen 3 3200G or even a AMD Ryzen 3 2200G?  Or is there actually a CPU and dedicated GPU combo that could beat this for price and performance?

This is replacing a Surface Pro 2.  I assume the performance improvement will be noticeable?

Thanks!

Every week at 18:16 on a tuesday my phone restarts. It's a samsung A7 2018 and has no battery problems. It restarted today at 61% and turned on the same. I have no idea why this happens. Help?
A little over week ago, I lost the left earbud of my galaxy buds. Looked all over for hours and still no luck. Fast forward to today while unloading my dishwasher. Boom. It was there. I don't even know how it got there. Charge it. It connects. Sound is as clear as my right bud and just as loud. Crazy. Samsung is amazing. 

What did we learn? 

Always check your dishwasher for lost items.
A step by step instruction is welcome. Thank you.
Hey, my name is Amy. I‚Äôm trying to build a custom PC, but I‚Äôm not very tech savvy, so I‚Äôm looking for some input on what I have put together so far. I used the PC Gamer website for info on the best parts for gaming PCs in 2019. I‚Äôm basically trying to stay in the mid-range for price, probably ending up around $1500-$2000. I‚Äôm also building for flair and aesthetic, and I reallllly like RGB! Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got:

CPU: Intel i7 9700K for ~$380 OR 
AMD Ryzen 7 3700X ~$325

Motherboard: Gigabyte Z390 Aorus Ultra ~$243

GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super ~$500

RAM: G. Skill TridentZ RGB 16GB DDR4 - 2400MHz ~$80 ***the site said that Ryzen builds prefer faster RAM, so if I go with a Ryzen CPU instead of Intel, what GPU would be best?***

Storage: Crucial PI 1TB NVMe ~$96

Mass storage (do I need both?): Samsung 970 Evo 1TB M.2-2280 NVMe SSD ~$170

PSU: Corsair RM850x ~$125 OR 
Gamdias Astrape PI-750G ~$105 (RGB!)

Chassis: CoolerMaster MasterCase H500M ~$196 (RGB) OR 
Nanoxia Deep Silence 3 ~$178 (quiet)
Corsair Carbide 275R ~$80
Corsair Obsidian 500D SE ~$175 RGB

Cooling: Corsair H115i RGB Platinum ~$150 (not compatible with all cases?) OR
Cooler Master MasterLiquid MC 360R ~$140 OR
Corsair H60 (2018) ~$70

Monitor: ASUS VG248QE ~$250 OR
Pixio PXC 273 ~$200

This all comes out to around $1,900. 

If you guys have any ideas for alternatives for some of these parts that are relatively similar, I‚Äôd love to hear them!

Thanks in advance!
I am looking for headphone for casual use. I want to use them mainly during Long study sessions (6+ hours) and also during commute to University and home. I would prefer that the headphones to be portable. It must be comfortable to wear for very long time and I also have big ears. A good sound Isolation would be nice.

**Budget** \- $100

**Source/Amp -** Samsung Galaxy S9 and Mac book **(**No Amp, i'm not planning on buying one**)**

**How the gear will be used** \- Mainly listening during studying and watching movies etc

**Preferred tonal balance -** I don't have much experience but I prefer Bass and clarity.

**Preferred music genre(s) -** Mainly instrumental musics, Movie soundtracks like the one from movie Interstellar, Indian Classical musics and sometimes retro synth-waves.

**Past** **gear experience -** I had Sony MDR-XB250 Extra Bass Headphones. I also had AKG earbuds supplied with Samsung S9. I like the clarity in audio that I got from AKG earphones. But I enjoyed the Bass from Sony. 

Currently I've narrowed the search to these three headphones

1. Sennheiser HD280PRO Headphone (new model).
2. Audio-Technica ATHM40x
3. AKG K361
4. Sennheiser 4.50 BTNC for $109 on amazon. 

Is wireless a good option? Any recommendations apart from these?
I was surprised to learn that Samsung doesn't support expanding the internal storage with an SD card, but I was happy to find another solution using ADB from a command line to format it. The command is:

  sm partition disk:179,xxx private

However, after rebooting the phone, it says SD card not recognized. 

Has anyone got this to work?
I purchased a 2080 super gaming x trio to pair with my i9 9900k. Was looking for some feedback on if I won or lost the lottery. 

Stock 2080s out of the box runs at 2070/2040 MHz. 
Overclocked the core to 2115/2100 MHz 
Overclocked the memory (Samsung) +1300 
Timespy score of 12,700 
Timespy graphics score of 13,000. 

What is everyone else‚Äôs results etc?
Hello All ! Have a few phones to sell. Please to not hesitate to ask me any questions. Local is 72701. All prices are negotiable but please do not waste your time low balling. Shipping is included in the price. [Timestamps 1](https://imgur.com/a/ujuf7YQ) [Timestamps 2](https://imgur.com/a/fWNglw8)

I will price match if you believe you have found a similar phone currently listed at a better price. This would have to be from a fairly major site (eBay, swappa, nothing too obscure) and it must be an active listing.

Phones cannot be unlocked unless otherwise stated. All IMEI and serial number info is in the photos.

Thanks!
I have some questions regarding my prospective CRG9 and wall-mounting:

1: I browsed through the official user's manual that's available online and Samsung says to use a wall mount where at least 10 cms (4 inches) are left between the monitor and the wall. That's definitely more than I'd like. My current monitor is on an ultra-flat mount with 1.7 cm clearance. It's basically two plates on the wall and one is removable. So do you think those 10 cms are just meaningless ass covering and I can get any mount that works, even very flat ones? Or is there an actual, genuine, non-exaggerated safety consideration there? Does the back heat up a lot? I have wallpaper if it helps. :P

2: This is a weird question, but... is the "circle on the back" *perfectly* vertically centered? This might be unclear so I made a helper image. Does the red line cut the orange line precisely in half if it also cuts the circle in half? If the answer is "yes" and I know that, I can get the mount on the wall early and then the monitor goes on the mount straight out of the box.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking to buy the Q80R 65". It is currently priced at 1700.
I have Samsung smart tv and within a year technician had to come out three times to fix it. Still has issues. My ex had Samsung phone. Always had to factory reset it to make it work. Friend of mine had to file small claims court just get full refund on his shitty Samsung tv. Samsung sent him an apology for fucking up so bad. I have a faulty Samsung machine I purchased 4 months ago and it's been 3 months since I have been fighting Samsung for refund because they fucking me around. They sent 4 technicians who didn't give me service reports but told me washing machine is faulty but Samsung just not willing to give refund just offer exchange after complaining 3 times. Technicians are unprofessional liars and Samsung case management is even worse. Their customer service is as good as dog shit and they actually break the law with misleading warranty and services. To keep this simple, all Samsung products are faulty and crap and this year it has been in the news twice that they washing machines were catching on fire and how they mislead customers with claiming their phones were waterproof but it wasn't. So never ever buy anything from Samsung. Spend your money better. Sorry for the rant but you deserve a headache free Christmas.
I have the HW-K430 samsung sound bar. I want to use the tv remote to change the volume on the soundbar. My tv is also a samsung. Does anyone know how I could connect them? At the moment im using an optical cable.

Hello to all of you at r/hardwareswap! Up for sale today is my personal PC. **I am willing to sell the whole thing or part it out. Please feel free to DM me with offers, questions, or concerns.**

I started building my PC around the holidays in 2017 and have slowly added to it since then.

It works as both a powerful gaming PC and an effective workstation for video editing in Premier and DaVinci Resolve and mixing in FL Studio or other DAWs.

The PC is capable  of 60-144 FPS @ 2560x1440p on most contemporary games with high graphics settings. Easily capable of 144 FPS or more @ 1920x1080p.

PC is also VR Ready and handled gaming with my Oculus Rift with no problems at all.

PC boots to Windows 10 Pro in less than 7 seconds with ultra-fast boot enabled in UEFI/BIOS.

Specs are as follows:

* CPU - Ryzen 5 1600X
* CPU Cooler - Corsair H100i all-in-one closed-loop liquid cooler
* Motherboard - ASRock K4 Fatal1ty - AB350 chipset - AM4 Socket
* RAM - 4 x 8 GB DIMMs - DDR4 - 3200 MHz - G.Skill TridentZ with Hynix modules
* GPU - EVGA GTX 1080 SC ACX 3.0
* PSU - EVGA G3 550 W
* Storage - Samsung 960 EVO M.2 NVMe SSD - 500 GB - Boot Drive+ Samsung 850 EVO M.2 SATA 3.0 SSD - 500 GB+ Seagate Firecuda SATA 3.0 SSHD - 2 TB+ Western Digital Caviar Black SATA 3.0 HDD - 1 TB
* Case Fans - 3x Noctua HF-14 fans - 140 mm - ultra-quiet
* Case - Fractal Design Define R5 - no side window - ultra-quiet

The PC also includes all original software and accessories for components, including additional drive bays, case panels, cables, etc.

Asking $1500 for the whole thing, **but I am open to reasonable offers!** I am selling to pay for college since I lost my job, so I can't afford to take a bath on it.

Thanks for reading!
If it wasn‚Äôt for iMessage, Samsung‚Äôs would be the majority of phones sold imo. I own an iPhone :/ and had to pay $600 to get the internals repaired after dropping it once with a case on it. If you have an older version of the iPhone and upgrade to the current OS, your phone slows down. Someone object my statements please.
Hi forum, I really hope this is the right place to ask.  I have a Samsung 65" LED 2160p Smart 4K Ultra HDTV (model  UN65MU6070FXZA).  HDR works fine for Blurays, XBOX One games, and everything in general, but when I stream 4K HDR it's giving me some weird blooming effect.  [This isn't the best example since it's a photo of my TV, but you can see the blushing effect on the girl's face](https://i.imgur.com/xaict6j.jpg).  It's definitely tied to the HDR somehow, I just haven't been able to diagnose the problem.  I'm streaming via an Amazon Fire device.  Any ideas?
OK, I'm looking to get one of these TVs this week on a Black Friday deal. I'm happy enough with my choice of Samsung, mainly for the OS and price points, however my choice is narrowed between the RU7400 and the RU8000. The 7400 is ¬£449 and the 8000 is ¬£639.

Can someone in simple terms, just explain to me the difference between the 2 of them please, and if the 8000 really is worth the extra ¬£190?
HELLO GOOD PEOPLE 
 I'm Here to ask  about microphone  on android .. when I record games on android ..I find that The recorder used internal microphone  even my headphones r pluged in ..means he used the mic on the phone .so it catches other sounds + game's sounds  .... But All I wanna is To catch my headphone's sound and the game sound .... i wanna ask if there's any app or option 
By the way  i Have Samsung J8 And I use His own Recorder means there's already an option of recording in it
Hiya, just looking for advice on my rig for playing games/occasionally watching films. 

I want a GPU with ray tracing capabilities that can support 4K - is the RTX 2080 Super good enough?

For my SSD I was thinking maybe a Samsung 860 1TB.

Now the main part for which I'm not sure is the cooler. Is liquid significantly better than gas? What are the least noisy ones?

Trying to keep this below $3000 but doesn't matter too much.

Thanks for the advice
First time posting but I have a lot of stuff that needs to go. Prices are pretty firm but don't be shy and pm me an offer. Willing to part out from my desktops if there's something you like in there. I can provide proof of TBW (Terabytes Written) for the SSD's and CDI for the HDD's

Local to 07080 and surrounding areas. Can ship but prefer local.

Looking to trade for a 4 TB Samsung SSD or a 2 TB 970 Evo Plus NVME or a 9900K/KS. Also will consider 2080 super and 2080ti's.

Need help!

Now that black Friday is approaching I have my sights on 2 tv's 

&amp;#x200B;

Samsung RU8000 - 65in ($797)

[https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN65RU8000FXZA-FLAT-UHD-Smart/dp/B07NC6M3VR/ref=sr\_1\_3?keywords=samsung%2B8%2Bseries&amp;qid=1573334725&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;sr=8-3&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN65RU8000FXZA-FLAT-UHD-Smart/dp/B07NC6M3VR/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=samsung%2B8%2Bseries&amp;qid=1573334725&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;sr=8-3&amp;th=1)

&amp;#x200B;

Samsung Q60R - 55in ($697$)

 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N4M9TL9/ref=twister\_B07NW2PJ2V?\_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N4M9TL9/ref=twister_B07NW2PJ2V?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now this will be going into my bedroom, nothing to crazy just gaming / netflix / movies here and there.

Pretty much its either go with a bigger 65in screen with(less image quality) or go for a QLED smaller screen 55in (better image quality for a 100$ difference.

I use the Strava Android app with my Samsung S10. I have a case that distorts the gps signal, causing erratic mapping. Just wondering if folks here who use the app have found phone cases that don't disrupt the GPS signal? If so, what case are you using? Thanks! Currently i just run without my case on, so living life on the edge a bit
Edit: Im confused why I was downvoted lol

I cannot find my box anywhere, its somewhere in a box in storage as I moved this past month. I do have the OEM fast charger though.

Barely used this a month, but my laptop is on its last legs and I cannot go any time at all without gaming. It has a clean IMEI and no FRP lock (I can send proof if you'd like).

Big helps for the gaming laptop are high refresh rate screens and a good GPU/CPU (obviously lol). Let me know what you have! I also am open to cash, so let me know what you think a fair price is and we can go from there.
